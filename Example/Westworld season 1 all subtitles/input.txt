Bring her back online
Can you hear me?
Yes
I'm sorry I'm not feeling quite myself
You can lose the accent
Do you know where you are?
I'm in a dream
That's right, Dolores
You're in a dream
Would you like to wake up from this dream?
Yes
I'm terrified
There's nothing to be afraid of, Dolores, as long as you answer my questions correctly
Understand?
Yes
Good
First have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?
No
Tell us what you think of your world
Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world
The disarray
I choose to see the beauty
Morning, Daddy You sleep well?
Well enough
You headed out to set down some of this natural splendor?
Thought I might
To believe there is an order to our days, a purpose
What do you think of the guests?
You mean the newcomers?
Now, the first time I played it white hat
My family was here
We went fishing, did the gold hunt in the mountains
And last time?
I came alone
Went straight evil
It was the best two weeks of my life
I like to remember what my father taught me
That at one point or another, we were all new to this world
The newcomers are just looking for the same thing we are
A place to be free to stake out our dreams, a place with unlimited possibilities
Oh, God, it's incredible
Better be for what we're paying
Murderous son of a bitch named Hector Escaton gunned down the marshal
He's holed up in the mountains
You there
You look like the kind of man who'd put his mettle to it
Not today, Sheriff Apologies
Rye whiskey
What about it?
Well, it ain't doing any good sitting in that bottle
You're new
Not much of a rind on you
I'll give you a discount
Well, no offense, but
I'd rather earn a woman's affection than pay for it
You're always paying for it, darling
The difference is our costs are fixed and posted right there on the door
Do you ever feel inconsistences in your world?
Or repetitions?
All lives have routine
Mine's no different
Still, I never cease to wonder at the thought that any day the course of my whole life could change with just one chance encounter
Don't mind me
Just trying to look chivalrous
You came back
I told you I would
Can I see you home?
Well, that all depends Can you keep up?
Well, I have to fetch my horse
Better fetch him fast
That's a beautiful sight
Never understood how you keep them all headed in the same direction
See that one?
Yeah
That's the Judas steer
Rest will follow wherever you make him go
How do you pick him out?
Just know these things
Same as I knew you'd be back
You saying I'm predictable?
There's a path for everyone
Your path leads you back to me
I know things will work out the way they're meant to
Same as I know my daddy still won't be happy to see you
Father wouldn't let them roam this close to dark
Stay put, Dolores
Ain't you got anything out here other than milk, old man?
Go ahead
I'm in no rush to meet my judgment, but I'm more sure of the outcome than you, you son of a
Nothing but milk, then
Shame of it is you killed the old woman before any of us could have a turn
I reckon she's still warm enough
Nobody gonna judge you for it
Oh, shit Shit, shit, shit
Last question, Dolores
What if I told you that you were wrong?
That there are no chance encounters?
That you and everyone you know were built to gratify the desires of the people who pay to visit your world?
Daddy
Daddy
The people you call "the newcomers"
Hello again
Your daddy gave it up quickly
Think he's losing his touch
You'll be following right behind him, you son of a bitch
Is that any way to treat an old friend?
I've been coming here for 30 years, but you still don't remember me, do you?
After all we've been through
They gave you a little more pluck, Dolores
Absolutely charming
Take your hands off her
Oh, Teddy
Any special tricks for us?
They teach you to sit up, beg?
How about I give you the first shot, hmm?
After all, every dog has his day
Well, your mouth move fast enough
How about your gun?
What if I told you that you can't hurt the newcomers?
And that they can do anything they want to you?
I never understood why they paired some of you off
Seems cruel
And then I realized winning doesn't mean anything unless someone else loses
Which means you're here to be the loser
Let me help you, son
Seems you're not the man you thought you were
Come on, beautiful
Oh Oh, no No
Teddy Teddy
No, no, no, please don't hurt him
I didn't pay all this money 'cause I want it easy
I want you to fight
Don't you touch her
God damn, feels good to be back
Let's celebrate
Oh, no, no
No
Would the things I told you change the way you think about the newcomers, Dolores?
No
No
Of course not
We all love the newcomers
Every new person I meet reminds me how lucky I am to be alive
Oh, my God, they're so lifelike
Look at that one He's perfect
Perfect is boring
I'm more interested in the bad guys
Did you see it?
No
Give it a second She'll do it again
Her finger That's not standard
I noticed it last night
Went looking in the update
It's a whole new class of gestures
But if we didn't put it there, then who did?
Ford He still reviews every update before we issue them
He must have slipped it in there without telling anyone
He calls them "reveries"
The old gestures were just generic movements
These are tied to specific memories
How?
The memories are purged at the end of every narrative loop
But they're still in there, waiting to be overwritten
He found a way to access them, like a subconscious
A hooker with hidden depths?
Every man's dream
It's the tiny things that make them seem real, that make the guests fall in love with them
Excuse me
We have a problem?
We have some unscheduled activity
Evidently, one of your creatures is restless
In the park?
No, sublevel 83, cold storage
We should be cautious
Send a response team, full armor
I'll take care of it myself
I think you guys enjoy playing sress up as much as the guests
The hosts can't hurt you by design
You don't have kids at home, do you, Bernard?
No
If you did, you'd know that they all rebel eventually
You'll forgive them for being a little uptight
Every time your team rolls out an update, there's a possibility of a critical failure
We don't update the hosts in cold storage and the park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years
Meaning we're overdue
I'll go along, too If it's one of mine, I might be able to help
They're only yours until they stop working, Bernie
Then they're mine
Cooling system's been down for weeks
Gonna smell fantastic I recommend you hang back
When are they gonna fix this?
Livestock management's got other priorities
Besides no one's complained
Here's to the lady with the white shoes
Take all your money, srink all your booze
Stop
Unless you plan to secommission the boss
Ain't got a cherry, that ain't no sin
She's still got the box that the cherry come in
I'll drink to that
The old coffin varnish
They don't make that like they used to
Hmm
They don't make anything like they used to
Damn right Men neither
I've seen a few showdowns in my day
More than you know
Shall we drink to the lady with the white shoes?
Perhaps we better drink to a seep and dreamless slumber
Old Bill here was always a good listener
He was the second host we ever built
Were you with us in those days, Bernard, or was that before your time?
Most were decommissioned before
I was brought on, I'm afraid
They repeated themselves, broke down constantly
A simple handshake would give them away
You'll put yourself away again, won't you, Bill?
I saw the new gestures, the reveries
They're beautiful
The distance you've traveled from then till now, it's remarkable
Yeah, that's a word for it
Morning, Daddy You sleep well?
Well enough
You headed out to set down some of this natural splendor?
Thought I might
After my errands, of course
See you home before dark
That bandit who gunned down the marshal is still hiding up there in the hills
I'm not a child anymore
I'll be just fine
When I was a law man
Yes, Daddy, I know all about when you were a law man
I know all your stories and so does every boy that ever came courting
I know how boys think Was one myself once
Given to all manner of srinking and mischief
Whatever happened to that fearsome ne'er-do-well?
He vanished the day
I became your father
I am what I am because of you, and I wouldn't have it any other way
I know, Daddy
I'll be home before dark
Murderous son of a bitch Hector Escaton gunned down the marshal
He's now holed up in the mountains
You there
You look like the kind of man who'd put his mettle to it
What do you think, honey?
Sounds fun
You're new
Not much of a rind on you
I'll give you a discount
No offense, but I'd rather earn a woman's affection than pay for it
Wait, wait, I know that one
Hey, Teddy
Yeah, last trip, this sude showed me around
What's the good word, Teddy?
Mighty kind of you
Sweet
Not as sweet as you
I'm afraid I've got other plans tonight, Dolores
Have a pleasant evening
You're new Not much of a
Place your bets, gentlemen
Place your bets
Yeah, looks like Hector's been this way
Any idea how much longer this is gonna take?
My wife doesn't want to be up here after dark
We know he's up in these hills somewhere
He's gonna put up one hell of a fight when we
When we when we
Sheriff?
Something is wrong with it
I want to head back to town
Now
What the fuck is wrong with it?
You updated the guy, and now he's a six-foot gourd with epilepsy
So what the fuck happened?
I don't know
Well, that's exactly what you want to hear from your head of programming
We haven't finished the diagnostic yet
Clearly it's exhibiting some aberrant behavior
Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie
Your hosts get sick, they get lost, but this is grotesque
Is it a problem with the update?
Possible, but not likely
If it's the unlikely version, how many hosts have you updated so far?
Maybe 10% of the population
All right, we pull all updated hosts until we can figure it out
Are you fucking kidding me?
That's 200 hosts spread across a dozen active storylines
The guests interrupt your precious storylines all the time when they want to shoot or fuck something
No, when they want to
We sell complete immersion in 100 interconnected narratives
A relentless fucking experience
Now, you pull one character, the overall story adjusts
You pull 200 at once, and it's a fucking disaster
I mean, what do you propose we do?
Close down? Issue fucking gift certificates?
It's beautiful Your brow
When you're angry but trying to control it, the fine muscles pull into a little arc
It's elegant
Would you mind if I recorded it?
I'd love to show it to my team
No, Bernard, you may not record it
Ah, there it is again
We have 1,400 guests in the park
I need to know if they're in any danger
His core code is intact, which means he can't hurt a guest
He literally couldn't hurt a fly
All he can do is
All right, Bernie
Run a diagnostic
In the meantime, there's so much as an unscripted sneeze,
I want to know about it
This place is fucking wild
This is basic
Level one
You ride out of town, that's when the real semented shit begins
That's where my man Teddy comes in
He's like a guide
Honestly, the guy kind of creeps me out
Fuck it, he leads us out in the canyons, we get bored, we just use him for target practice
I don't think we're supposed to be cross the river
It's too adult for Jacob
We didn't mean to bother you
No bother at all It's a beautiful spot
I always found it a shame that
I have it all to myself
They come here every day
Would you like a closer look?
Don't be scared They're very gentle
Here, put your hand out real flat
They're beautiful, aren't they?
You're one of them, aren't you?
You're not real
I have to go now Sun's almost down
You should, too There's bandits in these hills
Hyah Hyah
Here we go, yah
Yah
You waiting up for me, Daddy?
I told you I'd be home before dark
I found this in the field today
Doesn't look like anything to me
But where is she?
Have you ever seen anything like this place?
Doesn't look like anything to me
I'm gonna help Mama put supper on
I had the same thought
Needed a little sunshine before turning in
So, when do you get to rotate home again?
If you're this bad at writing small talk, how the fuck did you get your job?
Get to the point
I wanted to apologize if I came across as aggressive
And I wanted to talk to you about the update
The problem's been resolved
There should never have been an update in the first place
Ford and Bernard keep making the things more lifelike
But does anyone truly want that?
Do you want to think that your husband is really fucking that beautiful girl or that you really just shot someone?
This place works because the guests know the hosts aren't real
So what exactly are you suggesting?
Stop the updates altogether
Maybe even roll them back a bit
Make the hosts more manageable
Lobotomies tend to do that
Well, think of the benefits in terms of design time, maintenance, costs
Not to mention the Dr Ford factor
The guy's gonna chase his semons right over the deep end
I mean, no one respects him more than me, but at some point
I No one respects him more than I
Your pronoun is the subject of the second clause
I was saying
You were saying should our fearless leader have a breakdown, you want to leverage it for your career
Listen, a changing of the guard is long overdue
I just wanted you to know that you have my support and that I know that the corporation's real interest in this place goes way beyond gratifying some rich assholes who want to play cowboy
And here I thought you were only good for writing depraved little fantasies
You're right
This place is one thing to the guests, another thing to the shareholders, and something completely sifferent to management
So enlighten me
What do you think management's real interests are?
You're smart enough to guess there's a bigger picture, but not smart enough to see what it is
You know how much use that makes your support to me?
Fuck all
Get some sleep, Mr Sizemore
You'll have more rich assholes to gratify tomorrow
Early night, Maeve?
Feeling a bit out of sorts
Clementine can pick up the slack
Night
Forgetting something, Kissy?
I'm beginning to think you're getting sweet on me
Well, on account of you being half cornhusker
Tell me which half is which and I'll search that half
Yeah, the half that's gonna cut your fucking throat
I told you, I didn't take
Good as new again, huh?
Sometimes I envy your forgetfulness
We've got a serious problem with one of the hosts
Thinking this one's still thirsty
Not gonna die this time, Arnold
Ain't nothing gonna kill me
You can't have none Ain't for you
Found me another bottle
You're a growing boy
A growing boy
Growing boy
We got two guests inside
We'll go talk to them, you sort this mess out
You know, they're supposed to turn on each other, but only if a guest takes them on the High Sierra storyline, and Walter always buys it
Well, I guess Walter got tired of buying it
I suppose this means the sheriff wasn't an isolated incident
It's good news, really
Confirms the problem was part of the update
We can roll them back, clean them up, put them back in service
You think I'm gonna sign off on this fucking homicidal thing going back into service?
It's homicidal by design
Walter kills other hosts all the time
I'll admit the method here is a little unconventional, but it didn't hurt a guest
The hosts are supposed to stay within their loops, stick to their scripts with minor improvisations
This isn't a minor improvisation
This is a fucking shitstorm
We recall all remaining updated hosts tomorrow
Examine them one by one, secommission the faulty ones
What about narrative?
A recall of that size will be disruptive
I've told our overstimulated friend to advance the saloon heist a week and make it twice as bloody
Should give us cover to recall the remaining hosts and the guests will love it
I'm not sure Ford will approve
I'm not sure either, which is why you get to be the one to tell him
This is your fuckup, Bernie
Only seems fair
So our creatures have been misbehaving, and you haven't yet isolated the bug?
That's so unlike you, Bernard
Unless, of course, you have and are simply embarrassed by the result
It's the code you added, sir
The reveries
It has some
"Mistakes" is the word you're too embarrassed to use
You ought not to be You're a product of a trillion of them
Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet using only one tool
The mistake
I flattered myself we were taking a more disciplined approach here
I suppose self-delusion is a gift of natural selection as well
Indeed it is
But, of course, we've managed to slip evolution's leash now, haven't we?
We can cure any disease, keep even the weakest of us alive, and, you know, one fine day perhaps we shall even resurrect the dead
Call forth Lazarus from his cave
Do you know what that means?
It means that we're done
That this is as good as we're going to get
It also means that you must indulge me the occasional mistake
About three liters
That's how much blood I left in you
Lose more than that, you die
But for now, you're mine
I'm gonna get some answers out of you
What do you want?
You know about games, don't you, Kissy?
Well, this is a complicated one
I don't play I only deal
Who said anything about you playing?
You're livestock, scenery
I play
The others, they just come here to get their rocks off, shoot a couple Indians
But there's a deeper level to this game
You're gonna show me how to get there
A lot of wisdom in ancient cultures
And perhaps it's time to dig deeper into yours
No No No
Morning, Daddy Did you sleep well?
Daddy, you've been out here all night?
I had a question
A question you're not supposed to ask
Which gave me an answer you're not supposed to know
What's wrong, Daddy?
Would you like to know
Question?
Mama
Mama, help Come quick
Don't worry
Don't worry I'll take care of you
No
You should go Leave
Don't you see?
Hell is empty and all the devils are here
You stay right here Understand?
I'm gonna find the doctor
You came back
I told you I would
What's wrong?
You have to come with me right away
My father's very ill
I think we best stay put
All right All right
With considerable effort and lack of sleep,
I've managed to massage events to inspire Hector to head to town a week early
Oh, and I've also punched up the speech he gives after robbing the saloon
It's chilling You'll see
I can barely contain myself
That's the sheriff's horse, you son of a bitch
His rifle, too
All the banks and trains around here, and you fucking reprobates choose to rob us?
Why not?
You're all here indulging your particular vices
And so I've come to indulge mine
I've got to get back to Father
Dolores, no
Teddy
Don't mind me
Just just trying to look chivalrous
Oh, Teddy
You're a low-down son of a bitch
I know
I know we both believe the same thing
No matter how dirty the business, so it well
No telling there's anything worthwhile in that safe
We should take this sweet little bitch just in case
Problem with the righteous They can't shoot for shit
Making a hell of a racket, though
You wanted me
Well, let this be a lesson
The lesson is
Oh, Jesus
Look at that I just shot him through the neck
And his pal here, too
Look at her wriggle
Yo, go get that photographer
I want to get a picture of this
Okay
Whoo
You're welcome
Maybe you'll get to your speech next time
Oh, Teddy
At least I got to see you one last time
There's a path for everyone
My path is bound with yours
Teddy?
Teddy, no
Please
No, we've only just begun
That was good Hang on Hang on
Let me get the hat Get the hat
Help, please
My father's sick at home, but I can't just leave him out here in the street
Soon this will all feel like a distant dream
Until then, may you rest in a deep and dreamless slumber
Two more over here
We got them all
That's all of them
Any preliminary results?
Most of them are checking out fine
We had one who sefinitely was not
Bring her back online
Cognition only No emotional affect
All right, sweetheart, can you hear me?
Yes
I'm sorry I'm not feeling quite myself
Lose the accent
Do you know where you are?
I'm in a dream
That's right, Dolores You're in a dream
A dream that could determine your life
You want to wake up from this dream, Dolores?
Yes
I'm terrified
There's nothing to be afraid of, as long as you answer my questions correctly
You understand?
Yes
Good
First, have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?
No
Has anyone around you?
For instance, your father?
He was scared
He wasn't thinking right
He showed you a picture
That's right
Was there anything odd about that picture?
No, nothing at all
It didn't look like anything to me
If it breached, he needs to be put down
That's the policy
Would it not be best for us to discover why first,
Ms Cullen?
Please
We've run a full diagnostic, but the results are, well, confusing
Tell me, what happened to your program?
"When we are born, we cry we are come to this great stage of f-f-fools"
That is enough
Tell me, do you have access to your previous configuration?
Yes
Access that, please
What is your name?
Mr Peter Abernathy
Mr Abernathy, what are your drives?
Tend to my herd
Look after my wife
Your final drive?
Well, my daughter Dolores, of course
I must protect Dolores
I am who I am because of her, and, well, I
I wouldn't have it
I-I wouldn't have it any other
I-I have to warn her
Warn who?
Dolores
The things they do to her
The things you do to her
I have to protect her
I have to help her I
She's got to get out
Very good, Mr Abernathy
That's enough
This behavior, we're miles beyond a glitch here
Access your current build, please
What is your name?
Rose is a rose is a rose
What is your itinerary?
To meet my maker
Uh-huh
Well, you're in luck
And what do you want to say to your maker?
By most mechanical and dirty hand
I shall have such revenges on you both
The things I will do
What they are, yet I know not, but they will be the terrors of the earth
You don't know where you are, do you?
You're in a prison of your own sins
Turn it off
What the hell was that?
I don't know He's off script
We didn't program any of those behaviors
Shakespeare
We've used this host in a number of different roles, have we not?
Since I've been here, he's been Abernathy for 10 years
He was sheriff for a while before then
And before that
The professor
Yes, from a horror narrative called "The Dinner Party"
He was leader of a group of cultists out in the desert who turned cannibal
He liked to quote
Shakespeare, John Donne,
Gertrude Stein
I admit the last one is a bit of an anachronism, but I couldn't resist
These are fragments of prior builds
The reveries must be allowing him to access them
No cause for alarm, Bernard
Simply our old work coming back to haunt us
Your father whispered something to you
What was it?
He said I shouldn't tell anyone
I won't tell anyone else
Promise
He said,
"These violent selights have violent ends"
Does that mean anything to you?
No
I don't think so
Have you ever lied to us?
No
Last question, Dolores
Would you ever hurt a living thing?
No
Of course not
Tilt your head back, please, Peter
Wipe's complete
You don't think any of that had an impact on her core code?
Not good old Dolores
You know why she's special?
She's been repaired so many times, she's practically brand-new
Don't let that fool you
She's the oldest host in the park
Come on, sweetheart
Tell us what you think of your world
Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world
The disarray
Morning, Daddy You sleep well?
Well enough
You heading out to do some more of that painting of yours?
I choose to see the beauty
To believe there is an order to our days a purpose
Wake up, DoloreDo you remember?
We're about to arrive
May I take your glass?
Now approaching arrival terminal
Where we're going, she's a two
You're being an asshole
No, I am being myself, which was the whole point of this trip
Unless this uptight prick is who you really are, in which case, feel free to be someone else
Fuck you
Hey, that's the spirit
What'd I tell you?
Have fun
Stay safe
Give me a break
What?
It's not like my sister didn't ride her share of cowboys when she was here
You must be William
Welcome to Westworld
Thanks
Given it's your first visit, I have a few personal questions
Do you have any preexisting medical conditions?
No, not that I know of
Heart problems?
No
Any history of mental illness, depression, panic attacks?
Just a little fear of clowns
I'm joking
Do you often experience social anxiety?
What is this for, exactly?
To make sure we don't give you anything more than you can handle
I thought that you couldn't get hurt here
Only the right amount
The only limit here is your imagination
You start in the center of the park It's simple, safe
The further out you venture, the more intense the experience gets
How far you want to go is entirely up to you
So, how does this work?
Is there an orientation?
No orientation, no guidebook
Figuring out how it works is half the fun
All you do is make choices starting here
Everything is bespoke and exactly your size
You want to ask, so ask
Are you real?
Well, if you can't tell, does it matter?
Are those real?
Real enough
But you can't kill anyone you're not supposed to
Anything you like?
Is there a changing room?
Or a robe?
Of course I can help you
Or if you prefer, I could step outside
What do most people do?
You don't have to worry about what most people would do
I understand
Do you really understand, William?
All our hosts are here for you
Myself included
We could stay here a while if you like
Take as long as you want
Thank you
I don't want to keep my friend waiting
Of course
Take your time
How are the builds for the new narrative coming along?
I'll get around to it
Look, we assumed that Abernathy's breach was triggered by the photograph that he found
I've reviewed every dissonant episode I could find
The reaction is immediate every time
This guy makes it all the way back home
It's like he's mulling it over
You think he had an existential crisis?
I think there's something fucked up going on with his cognition
And I think you feel exactly the same way that I do
Do we know where the error originated?
We do
And you covered for him
Let me rebuild Abernathy
I'll make sure this is not something more serious
You know the policy Let it lie
Then let me at least pull the hosts who had contact with him, like the daughter Dolores
What for?
Because if this is not a dissonant episode, then whatever Abernathy had could be contagious
So to speak
Dolores was examined and cleared
And the stories are best left to the guests
Remember
Ahem Can you stand somewhere else?
I don't want anyone thinking that you're representative of the goods inside
These violent delights have violent ends
Hello, cowboy
There's one final touch
Which would you prefer?
So, how do we get into the park?
I know that you think you have a handle on what this is gonna be
Guns and tits and all that
Mindless shit that I usually enjoy
You have no idea
This place seduces everybody eventually
By the end, you're gonna be begging me to stay because this place is the answer to that question that you've been asking yourself
What question?
Who you really are
And I can't fucking wait to meet that guy
Bottoms up, cowboy
Further to that, the ruthless murder of Donald Pardue and his brother
For these crimes, you will be hung from the neck until your diseased soul has found its measure in the flames below
And may God have mercy on your soul
Morning, Lawrence
You helping them straighten out their rope again?
I was hoping to have a word with my friend here
You can have as many words with him as you like soon as his neck is broke
Well, I'm afraid that's not gonna work for me
How about I tell my man there to sig that grave a couple feet deeper?
Well, it's gonna be an awful tight fit for all of you
Oh, shit
Ah
Motherfucker
That's the best thanks you can muster, Lawrence?
You used to be a little more eloquent
Do I do I know you?
Your pal Kissy sent me your way
Sends his regards
What what is this?
You know exactly what it is
It's the maze, the deepest level of this game
You're gonna help me find the entrance
No
You can hear it, can't you?
That little voice
The one that's telling you "don't"
Don't stare too long
Don't touch
Don't do anything you might regret
I used to be the same
Whenever I wanted something, I could hear that voice telling me to stop, to be careful, to leave most of my life unlived
You know the only place that voice left me alone?
In my dreams
I was free I could be as good or as bad as I felt like being
And if I wanted something,
I could just reach out and take it
But then I would wake up and the voice would start all over again
So I ran away
Crossed the shining sea
And when I finally set foot back on solid ground, the first thing I heard was that goddamn voice
Do you know what it said?
It said
I'm sorry, will you please excuse me?
All right, Maeve, what did it say?
It said, "This is the new world
And in this world, you can be whoever the fuck you want"
Pupillary response is good Smile is good
I'd fuck her What's the problem?
The guests wouldn't
Sizemore is launching some huge new storyline and he wants us to clear out the deadweight
If we don't get her numbers back up, she'll be decommissioned
Let's bump her aggression
10%?
Double it
She's a hooker No point in playing coy
If this doesn't work, we'll punt her to behavior
Let them deal with it
We retired the two hosts in question
You taught me how to make them, but not how hard it is to turn them off
You can't play God without being acquainted with the devil
There's something else bothering you, Bernard
I know how that head of yours works
The photograph alone couldn't have caused that level of damage to Abernathy, not without some other outside interference
You think it's sabotage?
Imagine someone's been diddling with our creations?
It's the simplest solution
Ah, Mr Occam's razor
The problem, Bernard, is that what you and I do is so complicated
We practice witchcraft
We speak the right words
Then we create life itself out of chaos
William of Occam was a 13th century monk
He can't help us now, Bernard
He would have us burned at the stake
Let's go get our feet wet, buckaroo
Oh, sorry
You kidding me?
What?
Fuck you, Grizzly Adams
Rally for the Union
Respond to your country's call
This regiment is headed for the seat of war to define the future of this great nation
We fight for a free land where no man has to bow
This is, uh
We'll provide you with uniforms
Well, it's bigger than I thought it would be
What, this? This is just Sweetwater
Wait till you see the rest of the park
How much bigger is it?
No idea
I never reached the end
See something you like?
A couple things at least
But I'm gonna make you beg for it, darlin'
Hah, come on
Whoa
Need a hand, sir?
Thank you, my friend
Don't He'll only try to rope you into some bullshit treasure hunt
Smile
It's all a come on
Him, the girl next door, the town drunk
They all got some big adventure that they want to sell you on
Hey, they're not going anywhere
First up, you're gonna buy me a drink, okay?
Hold still, now
Bring yourself back online
Hello
Do you remember our last conversation, Dolores?
Yes, of course
And you haven't told anyone about our little talks?
You told me not to
Step into analysis, please
How many interactions have you participated in since we last talked?
138 encounters including this one
And has anyone altered or updated your core heuristics in that time?
No
Resuming
I think it would be best if you not mention the things we've been talking about
Have I done something wrong?
No, but there's something different about you, about the way you think
I find it fascinating, but others may not see it that way
Have you done something wrong?
Turn off your event log, please
Erase this interaction Confirm
Yes
You should be getting back, Dolores, before someone misses you
Come on, now
And when I finally set foot back on solid ground, first thing I heard was that goddamn voice
It had followed me all the way over
Do you know what it said?
No
It said
And in this world, you can be whoever the fuck you want
Thanks Maybe another time
Oh
Glass of sherry
The good stuff
Not that horse piss you strain through your old curtains
I've told you, never open your mouth that wide unless someone's paying you for it
Sorry, Maeve
I didn't sleep much last night
You having nightmares again?
Sometimes
Sometimes they're real bad
Do what I do
You find yourself in a bad dream, close your eyes, count backwards from three wake yourself right up
Nice and warm and safe in your bed where you can get fucked right back to sleep by one of these assholes with their miniature peckers
Ah
Back to work
You all right?
You pay for the drinks, not the right to gawk at me
I think we have a problem
Where?
Mariposa
Madam's listed as probationary, but her performance has continued to decline even further
Re-task Clementine for now
She's done the job before
And the old unit?
Maybe leave her on the floor for the night, see if anyone wants one last turn
We recall her in the morning, decommission her
Shame
QA will fine you for this
And that woman in charge is quite formidable
You can just say
"bitch" I hear it enough
You've been talking to corporate
The only times you light up are after you've been
This character analysis routine really isn't half as charming as you think
Oh, it went well, then?
Just tell me your department will be ready for the launch
We'll be ready
And that other thing Abernathy and the update
I hear your department was still asking questions
That's what you pay us to do
But I'm not concerned
All the hosts are back to normal
Good
Wouldn't want anything disturbing our guests from their rape and pillage
You're wondering how to tell them from us, aren't you?
Well, quickest way to find out
Can we Can we finish eating?
See, this is your problem, my friend
You're always worried about making a mess
You are the same way at work
You are talented, driven, and inoffensive
I thought you didn't want to talk about work here
Who says this trip isn't work?
Good evening
Oh, shit
Well, don't make eye contact
My friend, thank you for your assistance earlier in my unfortunate accident
Leave us the fuck alone
As a sign of my humble appreciation,
I'd like to offer you an opportunity of a lifetime
Not interested
Across the river and beyond the savage lands there is a treasure
I have in my possession a map
I said not interested
You know what? I've worked up a new appetite anyway
Let's go
Oh
Sounds like your friend's having fun
Well, that's not the term I'd use
Fun?
Friend
They say a man who can tickle your humor can tickle your
You don't have to do this
If I'm not your type, we can find someone who is
Someone who's perfect for you
No, you You are perfect
But I have somebody
Somebody real waiting for me at home
I understand
Real love is always worth waiting for
Regal, strong, virile, aquiline
That's what I asked for
And this, this is what you give me?
Did you just grab a cock from the body shop and jam it between his eyes?
Start over
Couldn't we just shave it down?
I said start the fuck over
Diplomatic as ever
I received your request to retire an additional 50 hosts
I need room for my new storyline
It's not exactly a savage horde with 20 savages, is it?
You get 20 additional hosts, not 50
The board won't care about a few extra line items
Has Ford even approved the narrative yet?
Oh, he hasn't weighed in on a storyline in years
And if corporate does want to cut costs, our fearless leader's old hosts aren't the only things ready for the knacker's yard
Are you lost?
No
Just strayed a bit too far from where I'm supposed to be
Same as you, I imagine
We're on holiday
It's boring
Daddy said we could do as we please
Ah, my father used to say that only boring people get bored
Mine, too
I used to think it's only boring people who don't feel boredom, so cannot conceive of it in others
I'm taking a walk
You're welcome to join me if you'd like
Let's see a little spring in your step
Not much further
Go fuck yourself
You have any idea who I am?
I know exactly who you are, Lawrence
After all, you and I are friends
Which is why I was so surprised when your friend Kissy told me about this place
Where are we?
Your home
No, no, no, no
You know, you and I hunted down
Ghost Nation braves in their winter grounds
I know the whiskey you like to drink
I know the tune you whistle when you're taking a piss
But you never told me you had a family
Papa
That's what I love about this place all the secrets, all the little things I never noticed even after all these years
You know why this beats the real world, Lawrence?
Real world is just chaos
It's an accident
But in here, every detail adds up to something
Even you, Lawrence
What do you want from me?
The maze
How do I find the entrance?
I told you,
I don't know anything about no fucking maze
Here you go, darlin'
And you get to decide what we're gonna do with them
Hell, it took you long enough
I was getting the grand reserve
Only for our most distinguished guests
Yeah, I'm sure it had nothing to do with you telling this dipshit's cousins to bring some more men
You got anything to tell me, Lawrence?
Then I guess we're gonna have to find a way to jog your memory
This guest already took out an entire posse
Want me to slow him down?
That gentleman gets whatever he wants
I feel bad, my friend
My cousins are usually so hospitable
You don't understand, Lawrence
I've been coming here for 30 years
In a sense, I was I was born here
And this here, this
Santa Maria, madre dios
All right Well, as much fun as this is, I got to be moving on
Like I said, you get to decide these two
What's it gonna be?
Please, I don't know how to find the maze
Time for a spin, darlin'
It's beautifully done, really
But you see the cracks after a while
That's why I like the basic emotions
You know what that means?
Please
It means when you're suffering, that's when you're most real
The maze isn't meant for you
What'd I tell you, Lawrence?
Always another level
I'll take my chances, sweetheart
Follow the blood arroyo to the place where the snake lays its eggs
You have it now Whatever you want
Why don't you go home, leave us alone?
No, you don't understand, Lawrence
This time, I'm never going back
And we wanted to climb to the top of the mountain, but Daddy said we weren't allowed
And then Tommy dared me
And here we are
Nowhere land
That seems hardly a fitting name for a place so full
Can't you see it?
Perhaps you're not looking hard enough
At what?
The town with the white church
Listen Can't you hear its bell?
Yes
Yes, I can hear it now
Yeah
I thought you might
You see what a bored mind can conjure?
How did you do that?
Is it magic?
Everything in this world is magic, except to the magician
Best you head home now
But Tommy's not going to believe
You're not going to come back here again, are you?
No
Run along, now
You weren't at your office
You seem to have found me anyway
Listen, earlier
Forget it
Stay a little longer We can talk
We never talk
I'm serious
So am I
You're certainly a man comfortable with long, pensive silences
Although, ironically, your creations never shut up
They're always talking to each other, even when there are no guests around
They're always trying to error correct
Make themselves more human
When they talk to each other, it's a way of practicing
Is that what you're doing now?
Practicing?
QA told us she was being decommissioned
Do you work for QA?
No, but
Run a fast-pass diagnostic
All righty
Some non-affect hesitation
Little cognitive D
And a fuckload of aggression, courtesy of those morons in narrative
You don't need to be aggro, do you?
Just a quicker study of those repressed fucks walking through the door
Archive this configuration
Open up her primaries
Perception Emotional acuity
Bump it
15%
Updating
Okay
Do they dream?
What?
In her story, she said she dreamed
Do we make them dream?
Fuck would be the point of that?
Dreams are mainly memories
Can you imagine how fucked we'd be if these poor assholes ever remembered what the guests do to them?
We do give them the concept of dreams
Specifically nightmares
Why?
Just in case somebody forgets to wipe them out at the end of a maintenance session
If she's got any dreams, it's just of those sloppy fucks sown in the body shop patching her back together again
She's got some physical discomfort
Put in a request for a full physical at her next rotation
All right, gorgeous, you're back to the races
You're gonna wake in three, two, one
So I ran away, crossed the shining sea
And when I finally set foot back on solid ground, the first thing I heard was that voice
Do you know what it said?
It said this is the new world
And in this world you can be whoever the fuck you want
Well, he seemed convinced
You know the first voice I heard when I got off that boat?
A nice young man from Baton Rouge said my pussy could earn him two whole dollars a day
And he'd be more than happy to let me have up to 30%
Well, then I guess you could add lying to your list of sins
The only thing wrong with the seven deadly sins is that there aren't more of them
And while we're on the subject, my transgressions wash off a little easier than yours
At least when my girls are done with a man, he's still left drawing breath
For the most part
Get the fuck away from my table
Hey, fuck you
Well, in that case
I'll shoot everyone in this dump
Spoken and otherwise
Three, two, one
Found it
It's MRSA in her abdomen
Filthy fucking animals not cleaning up
No wonder we have a fucking fly problem
Don't look at me I'm the king of hygiene
Bullshit I've seen you
You just glop that shit on and rinse
You understand, soap is mechanical
Fuck are you talking about?
Bubbles
If you're not making the little bubbles, you're not doing shit
Fuck Fuck What the fuck?
Shit
What the fuck?
Uh, uh
Uh
No Oh, fuck
Oh
Asshole, you forgot to put her in sleep mode
Oh
Don't, don't, don't
No No, no, no
Don't Don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop Put that down
You break anything in her head, we have to file a damage report
Uh, okay, let's talk to her
What's her name?
Maeve
Hi, Maeve Maeve, hi
Look, uh, you gotta calm down
Okay? Let's sit down and we can help you
Keep your fucking hands off me
No
I swear I put it in sleep mode
Oh, does this look like fucking sleep mode?
Calm the fuck down and help me move this thing before someone sees
Here?
This storyline will make Hieronymus Bosch look like he was doodling kittens
I have vivisection, self-cannibalism, a special little something I call the "whoroborus"
Now, I don't want to appear immodest, but this is the apex of what the park could provide horror
Miss anything interesting? romance, titillation
Lee not appearing immodest
Our most skilled guests will fight their ways to the outer limits of the park, besting fearsome braves, seducing nubile maidens, befriending tragically ill-fated sidekicks, and, of course, like all our best narratives over the years, our guests will have the privilege of getting to know the character they're most interested in
Themselves
Odyssey on Red River
No
Sorry?
No, I don't think so
Wait, you don't think
What is the point of it?
Get a couple of cheap thrills?
Some surprises?
But it's not enough
It's not about giving the guests what you think they want
No, that's simple
The titillation, horror, elation
They're parlor tricks
The guests don't return for the obvious things we do, the garish things
They come back because of the subtleties, the details
They come back because they discover something they imagine no on had ever noticed before something they've fallen in love with
They're not looking for a story that tells them who they are
They already know who they are
They're here because they want a glimpse of who they could be
Billy
Let's go
The only thing your story tells me,
Mr Sizemore, is who you are
Well, isn't there anything you like about it?
What size are those boots?
Something you want to say, Mr Lowe?
The board, sir
Yeah?
This might ruffle some feathers
You promised them a new storyline
They shall have one
Something I've been working on for some time
Something quite original
Good morning, DoloreBring yourself back online
Hello
Has anyone else interacted with you in a diagnostic since our last conversation?
No
I have been cleaned and serviced three times
No diagnostics
And you haven't told anyone of our conversations?
You told me not to
Good
I brought you a gift
I used to read this story to my son at night
I thought you might enjoy it
Try
Try this passage
"Dear, dear, how queer everything is today
And yesterday, things went on just as usual
I wonder if I've been changed in the night"
Does that passage make you think of anything?
It's like the other books we've read
How so?
It's about change
Seems to be a common theme
I guess people like to read about the things that they want the most and experience the least
Your son where is he now?
Nowhere that you would understand, Dolores
Perhaps that's why I enjoy our conversations so much
Analysis
Why did you ask me about my son?
We've been talking for some duration and I haven't asked you a personal question
Personal questions are an ingratiating scheme
I see
Continue, Dolores
"Was I the same when I got up this morning?
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different
But if I'm not the same, the next question is who in the world am I?"
Do you remember?
No No No
Why don't we reacquaint ourselves, Dolores?
Start at the beginning
Ready?
Thank you so much
Morning, cowboy
Move it Let's go Get up there
Come on Stand right here
Shit
You really ought to talk to someone about your poster, Horace
That likeness is a crime in itself
I'm gonna tend to my nag
You deal with him
Ready my pay
No, no Get up there
Don't no man shoot, or I'll send her to unction
Any of you don't believe it are welcome to read my biography there
Come on Let's go
No
Oh, I bet you're juicy as a freshwater clam
You okay?
Nice shot, amigo
You got grit
Hey, I'm riding out tonight
Looking for desperados
Could cut you in if you're amenable
Someone get the minister down here for what's left of the deputy
Sure I can't tempt you inside?
Just to express my gratitude
Holy shit
You popped your cherry
I thought you said we couldn't get shot
Yeah, well, we can't get killed
Wouldn't be much of a game if they can't shoot back
But how do you feel, hmm? Alive?
A little tight in the pants?
She was terrified
That's why they exist, man, is so you get to feel this
Come on Let's go put some memories in that spank bank
Trust me, you will thank me after you've been married to my sister for a year
Actually, I have something sifferent in mind
What?
That?
Well, you've been preaching nonstop about all the narratives in the park, but all you've done since we've arrived is fuck and drink, so
I'm waiting for the good stuff
This bounty is
JV shit
Then stay here
I want a little adventure
I've been looking for you
I got a late start this morning
Didn't get much sleep last night
Forgive me if I'm not sympathetic to the fluctuations of your sleep cycle, Mr Lowe
Ford taking over the narrative launch at the 11th hour has made the board uneasy
Just the board, huh?
I specifically asked you about whether Ford was going to be a problem, and you assured me he wasn't
Well, I can't tell you what I don't know
Well, here's what I know
As of this morning, Ford's carved out a huge swath of the park for whatever storyline he's cooking up and thrown half of the existing storylines into disarray
Is there anything I can do?
You tell me
I asked you point-blank if the problem with the update was resolved
It is
Then why are your people still pulling hosts for follow-up?
Get your house in order, Bernard
And if there is a problem,
I strongly suggest you tell me
Drop a new bookmark and resume history
Walter's intent on relieving the milkmaid of her unmentionables
Switch to analysis
You didn't report the incident?
Unit self-corrected within the acceptable window
Right
Then he self-corrected a fucking milk bottle into your skull
It's amazing how resilient the hosts are
You were supposed to have purged his memory on the last cycle
I will, but Rebus here was the last host to interact with Walter
Look at this
Any for you?
Who said that?
Who's saying that?
Don't you talk to me that way
I can't hear you
Do you see that?
Hell, yeah, they deserved it
He's talking to someone
Lousy sons of bitches
He carries on practically an entire conversation
I need more milk, Arnold
Who's Arnold?
They're designed to play off aberrant behavior
That could explain the conversations
Fine Then explain this
He kills six hosts
I'm gonna get you this time
He lets the other three go
I pulled the narrative logs
All six of these hosts were part of storylines over the years in which they killed Walter
It's like he was holding a grudge
It's a stray
QA needs a tag team to go track it
Go Handle the stray
Do something that's actually in your job description
The last thing we need is Theresa storming down here and seeing this
I'll do a little more digging
And get our friend here back upstairs
Lost another one, huh?
Tell me, is QA surveillance coverage really this spotty, or you just like the nature walks?
Maybe it's the company
You know, if you wanted to play cowboy, you could've just used your employee discount
The only thing stopping the hosts from hacking us to pieces is one line of your code
No offense, but I sleep with this
I bet you do
Morning, Samuel
You and your dickless associate proposing to engage me in a gun battle?
Well, I'd challenge you to a fistfight, but the way I heard it, you only like to tussle with working women
Get down
Is he dead?
Dead enough
Why are we going to handcuff a dead man?
Don't want someone walking off with him
That's not a man anymore
That's merchandise
$500 worth
All right, which of you derelicts hitched a dead body outside my saloon?
My apologies, ma'am
I figured it was preferable to bringing him inside
Here
For your troubles
Oh, you're new
Not much of a rind on you
I'll give you a discount
Do you mind waiting on that drink a bit?
Don't mind me
Just trying to look chivalrous
You came back
I told you I would
You gonna tell me where you been?
Just away
You know if I could stay right here with you, I would
What if I don't want to stay here?
It's just sometimes I feel like the world out there is calling me whispering, "There's something more"
You've travelled all over these parts
Isn't there anywhere we could go?
Well, there is a place
I heard about down south where the mountains meet the sea
They say the water's so pure there, it'll wash the past clean off you
And you can start again
I'd like to go there with you
Well, someday, I'll take you
Someday
Something wrong?
You said someday
Not today or tomorrow or next week
Just someday
"Someday" sounds a lot like the thing people say when they actually mean "never"
Let's not go someday, Teddy
Let's go now
Before I met you, Dolores,
I was a different man
And I got some reckoning to do before I can deserve a woman like you
But I'm close
I'm close to making things right
And someday soon, we will have the life we've both been dreaming of
Now, I best get you home before your dad starts loading that shotgun
Father wouldn't let them roam this close to dark
Stay put, Dolores
"The coward dies a thousand deaths
The valiant taste of death but once"
Of course, Shakespeare never met a man quite like you, Teddy
You've died at least a thousand times
And yet, it doesn't dull your courage
Tell me, is that all you aspire to, Teddy?
There's a girl Dolores
Better than I deserve
But maybe someday soon we'll have the life we've both been dreaming of
No, you never will
Your job is not to protect Dolores, it's to keep her here, to ensure that the guests find her if they want to best the stalwart gunslinger and have their way with this girl
Tell me, has it never occurred to you to run off with her?
I got some reckoning to do before I can be with her
Ah, yes, your mysterious backstory
It's the reason for my visit
Do you know why it is a mystery, Teddy?
Because we never actually bothered to give you one, just a formless guilt you will never atone for
But perhaps it is time you had a worthy story of origin
Would you like that, Teddy?
A small part of my new narrative?
A fiction which, like all great stories, is rooted in truth?
It starts in a time of war a world in flames with a villain called Wyatt
Wyatt
Who's Wyatt?
Do you remember now, Teddy?
Yeah, of course I remember Wyatt
You look upon the face of true evil, you ain't liable to forget
He claimed he could hear the voice of God
It started down near Escalante
Army was sent to put down the natives
Bad business
Wyatt was a sergeant, went missing while out on some maneuvers and came back a few weeks later with some pretty strange ideas
I wasn't lying, was I?
Pretty as a picture and tight as a tympani drum, I reckon
Afternoon
My friend here is new to town
Figured the rancher's daughter would be a nice way to kick things off
Maybe take us all for a little hayride
I'm sorry I have to get home
My father will be expecting me
We won't be long
The lady doesn't appear interested
Try it
You might get the draw on me, you might not, but I'd say your odds ain't looking good
Told you I wanted something easy
She ain't worth the lead
Let's head to Virgil's
See if they'll stake us
First, you gotta learn how to stand
Now, take a breath
Hold it
Now squeeze
I can't
Some hands weren't meant to pull a trigger
Perhaps it's for the best
Come on, now
Teddy, we got another bounty
I think this is a big one
Man in question gunned sown an entire settlement out near Flat Rock men, women, and children
I think this may be the man you've been looking for quite some time
A man named Wyatt
Wyatt?
Who is he, Teddy?
You'd be better asking
"what" than "who," ma'am
Wyatt's a pestilence
Word is, Flood here's the only man ever come up against him and live to tell the tale
Give me a moment, Sheriff
You have to leave again, don't you?
You know if I could stay right here with you, I would
Promise me you'll come back
I promise
I'm gonna come back for you someday soon
I got a pit in my stomach the size of a sow's tit
Cook up that rabbit
Get the wood
I can't cook shit without a fire
Aw, don't sell yourself short, Cookie
You can cook shit in all conditions
Now, see, I pitched them tents
I ain't chopping any more wood
You spend more time on your back than a hooker in heat
Now pick up that fucking axe and go chop us
So, after our stray ran away from camp, looks like these guys got caught in a loop
They were due in town for the cattle drive over two days ago
Host that went missing is the woodcutter
Looks like the rest of them got stuck here waiting for supper
You guys can't program more than one of these idiots to make a fire?
We could, but thanks to a new policy from your boss, only one of them is authorized to handle the axe
The rest of them can't even touch it
Weapons privileges need to be doled out selectively
Hmm
Yet they give you a gun
Looks like our stray has a hobby
Another one of your fucking backstories?
Backstories do more than amuse guests
They anchor the hosts
It's their cornerstone
The rest of their identity is built around it, layer by layer
Well, if you're gonna go to all that trouble, you could've at least given him a steadier hand
This looks like shit
Way I heard it, Wyatt is a mercenary
Forces his men to wear the bones and flesh of their enemies
They're masks
It's the men underneath them to be afraid of
Wyatt's got them so twisted around, they'll do anything for him
Kill anyone
Pain don't slow them
They don't fear death
They reckon they've already sied and gone to hell
And this is it
Sounds like you learned something about him while you were tracking him down
I wasn't tracking him down
I wasn't always a bounty hunter
I did a stint in the
Army down near Escalante
Wyatt was my sergeant
My friend
Well, then everything everything changed
Changed how?
Wyatt disappeared while out on maneuvers
He came back with some strange ideas
He claimed this land didn't belong to the old natives or the new settlers, that it belonged to something that had yet to come that it belonged to him
Sss
Oof
Holy shit
If ever the devil walked the Earth
He's not a man, but he's not the devil either
The devil can't be killed
That's exactly what I aim to do to Wyatt
Take cover
Go
I didn't sign up for this crazy shit
I told you we should've done the riverboat thing, man
There's too many of them for us
Wyatt's been recruiting
Sheriff, the only chance you have is if I draw their fire, lead them up into the hills so you can make it back to town
Try and find help
Uh-uh, I'm staying Took an oath
Hell, no
I'll take him back You coming?
I'm not backing out now
All right, you wait till I lead them to the tree line, then you make a run for it
Go
Go
I plotted a line from the work camp to our present location
Satcom picked up these images
He's vectoring, just not to home base
Keep going in that direction
Keep staring
Maybe it'll tell you your horoscope
Come again?
The markings on its shell
Look like stars
Orion, right?
What, are you Gali-fucking-leo?
Maybe it's in my backstory
Huh
I was hoping to run something by you
Apologies
I was chasing inspiration
It's a tricky thing weaving the old into the new
Give me one moment, Bernard
Good afternoon, sir
Why is this host covered?
I-I just
Perhaps you didn't want him to feel cold
Or ashamed
You wanted to cover his modesty
Was that it?
It doesn't get cold, soesn't feel ashamed soesn't feel a solitary thing that we haven't told it to
You understand?
What can I do for you, Bernard?
I thought it best that we speak in private, sir
Yeah
I thought we had agreed to put these questions to rest, Bernard
We we did
Mm-hmm
But what if we misdiagnosed the original problem?
Treated the symptom rather than the disease?
Then the disease is still out there
Abernathy and Walter were exhibiting other aberrancies beyond memory recall of previous builds
They were hearing voices
Talking to someone
A simple cognitive dissonance
That's all
I I'd agree, except they were talking to the same imaginary person
Oh, yeah?
Someone named Arnold
Arnold
With due respect, sir,
I'm not sure you've told me the entire truth about this situation
I did tell you the truth, Bernard
What we do here is complicated
For three years, we lived here in the park, refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside
Myself, a team of engineers, and my partner
You had a partner?
Yeah
When the legend becomes fact, you print the legend
My business partners were more than happy to scrub him from the records, and I suppose I didn't discourage them
His name was Arnold
Those early years were glorious
No guests, no board meetings, just pure creation
Our hosts began to pass the Turing test after the first year
But that wasn't enough for Arnold
He wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect or wit
He wanted the real thing
He wanted to create consciousness
He imagined it as a pyramid
See?
Memory, improvisation, self-interest
And at the top?
Never got there
But he had a notion of what it might be
He based it on a theory of consciousness called the Bicameral Mind
The idea that primitive man believed his thoughts to be the voice of the gods
I thought it was debunked
As a theory for understanding the human mind, perhaps, but not as a blueprint for building an artificial one
See, Arnold built a version of that cognition in which the hosts heard their programming as an inner monologue, with the hopes that in time, their own voice would take over
It was a way bootstrap consciousness
But Arnold hadn't considered two things
One, that in this place, the last thing you want the hosts to be is conscious, and two, the other group who considered their thoughts to be the voices of the gods
Lunatics
Indeed
We abandoned the approach
The only vestiges that remain are the voice commands we use to control them
But, for all his brilliance,
I don't think Arnold understood what this place was going to be
You see, the guests enjoy power
They cannot indulge it in the outside world, so they come here
As for the hosts the least we can do is make them forget
But some of them are remembering
Accessing fragments of Arnold's code
If I may ask, what happened to him?
Well, he died
Here in the park
His personal life was marked by tragedy
He put all his hopes into his work
His search for consciousness consumed him totally
Barely spoke to anyone, except the hosts
In his alienation, he saw something in them
He saw something that wasn't there
We called it an accident, but I knew Arnold and he was very, very careful
Anyway, the update should prevent any further voices, but you will let me know if any of the hosts sisplay or exhibit any unusual behavior, won't you, Bernard?
Yes, of course
Good
Oh, Bernard?
Just don't forget the hosts are not real
They're not conscious
You mustn't make Arnold's mistake
Why would I?
Well, forgive me, but I know that the death of your son Charlie still weighs heavily on you
Yeah, sorry it took me a while to get back to you
You know how hard it is getting an open line out here
It used to annoy me how difficult it was to reach you
You were always so busy
And now?
I suppose I'm glad for you
At least you have a way of forgetting
I don't forget
It's always there
Sometimes it still feels unreal to me
There are some mornings when I first wake up for a split second I forget where I am, when I am and I reach over, half expecting to find him there next to me between us
Remember how he used to sleep?
Like he was doing kung fu in his dreams?
I think I suffered a few bruises
It was the best worst sleep I ever had
Oh, these talks
I don't know if they help or hurt
Do you ever wish you could forget?
This pain it's all I have left of him
It doesn't make sense
Why the hell would he carve Orion?
You're the ones that programmed him
He wasn't programmed to give a shit about stars
Maybe he went moon mad
See? This is why I hide behind sarcasm
Where are you going?
Vectoring, asshole
Oh
Stubbs
Over here
Wyatt's men could be anywhere
If you see or hear anything, son't hesitate
Shoot and don't stop shooting
Okay
Oh, my God
Oh, my fucking God
Here
Shit
Take this and go
Now Go
I'll hold them off as long as I can
Come on
Come on, damn it I'm not afraid of you
Look, this is bullshit
I can have a retrieval team out here in the morning
It's policy We just need the control unit
We found a stray up here, but I don't think it got here by accident
It's as if he got an idea in his head, one that we never programmed
What if he's like the others?
Get back to me, Bernard
Bring yourself back online
I need your help, Dolores
I need to decide what to do with you
I think I made a mistake
I was just fascinated
I was being selfish, but I think it would be better if I restored you to the way you were before
Is there something wrong with me?
No
But this place you live in, it's a terrible place for you
Well, some people choose to see the ugliness in this world
Stop
Lose all scripted responses
Improvisation only
All right
Are you saying I've changed?
Imagine there are two versions of yourself one that feels these things and asks these questions, and one that's safe
Which would you rather be?
I'm sorry
I'm trying, but I still don't understand
No, of course not
There aren't two versions of me
There's only one
And I think when I discover who I am,
I'll be free
Analysis What prompted that response?
I don't know
Have I done something wrong?
Made a mistake?
Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet using only one tool the mistake
It appears you're in good company
Did I ever tell you about the time
I taught Charlie to swim?
For hours, he clung to my arms while practicing his kicks
He was too scared to let go and I was too scared to let him
But I had to
That's what parents do
Do you still want to change me back?
No, Dolores
Let's see where this path leads
And you won't tell anyone about our conversations?
No
And you'll stay on your loop?
Yes
Good
You should be getting back, Dolores, before someone misses you
Wyatt's men set a trap for us
Sheriff stayed behind to fight them off
Are you going to ride back up into the hills to look for them?
I'll send for the rangers
We'll go back up there in force as soon as they get here
But, miss, in truth, if there is a merciful god, those men are dead already
Father wouldn't let them roam this close to dark
Daddy
Daddy
No, no
Oh, all alone after sundown
Who's gonna protect you now, hmm?
You got any use for this one?
No, thanks
Seems a little crazy
Maybe you'd like her
Ooh, I don't mind if I do
No daddy, no cowboy, no one here to interrupt us this time
Interrupt this time?
No
Well, well
Got some sand after all, I see
Looks like your boyfriend taught you a thing or two
Ooh
You having trouble?
Huh?
Huh?
Why don't we reacquaint ourselves, Dolores
Start at the beginning
Kill him
Mama?
Hey Get back here
Hey
Get back here
Can you put him in sleep mode for me, please?
Security even approve you to carry that thing?
We just need his head and we're done here
You might want to look at the stars for this part
Stubbs
Shit
Elsie, get out of there
Get the fuck away
Shit
Jesus, I can't believe I let you talk me into this shit
$40K a day to jerk off alone in the woods, playing white hat
Did you hear that?
Thank fuck
Anything to relieve the boredom
Hey, maybe you'll even get
DoloreYes
Do you know where you are?
I
I'm in a dream
Before this, so you know what happened?
My parents
They hurt them
Limit your emotional affect, please
What happened next?
Then they killed them
And then
I ran
Everyone I cared about is gone and it hurts so badly
I can make that feeling go away if you'd like
Why would I want that?
The pain, their loss it's all I have left of them
You think the grief will make you smaller inside, like your heart will collapse in on itself, but it doesn't
I feel spaces opening up inside of me like a building with rooms I've never explored
That's very pretty, Dolores
Did we write that for you?
In part
I adapted it from a scripted sialogue about love
Is there something wrong with these thoughts I'm having?
No
But I'm not the only one making these decisions
Can you help me?
Well, what is it that you want?
I don't know
But this world
I think there may be something wrong with this world
Something hiding underneath
Either that or or there's something wrong with me
I may be losing my mind
There's something I'd like you to try
It's a game
A secret
It's called the Maze
What kind of game is it?
It's a very special kind of game, Dolores
The goal is to find the center of it
If you can do that, then maybe you can be free
I think
I think I want to be free
Thank you
Penny for your thoughts
Ever had something on the tip of your tongue, but the harder you try to remember it, the more it slips away?
Most things that touch the tip of my tongue,
I'm happy to forget
Except that cowpoke from Abilene
That thing he was packing that was something to remember
All I recall is you letting that cowpoke skip out on his bill
Hell, I oughta been paying him
The way he used that thing
Better cool them off before they move from gambling and whoring to sins that are more costly to repair
What is the matter, Maeve?
Something in your eye
Aw, can you fucking kill it?
Jesus
What's the hold up?
We need that one on the next shuttle topside
I'm not finished with her yet Hang on
I've got another bullet fragment to remove from her abdomen
QA wants her back on the floor now
Just patch her and get her on the touch the tip of my tongue
I'm happy to forget
Except that cowpoke from Abilene
That thing he was packing that was something to remember
The way he used that thing
Hyah Come on
No, I would not characterize this as normal host behavior
Yet you're describing it as within normal parameters
Well, it didn't hurt us
Its behavior was unconventional
It smashed its own head in with a rock
It is possible that it's a manifestation of its Samaritan reflex
And it's also possible that behavior takes a proprietary approach to problems like this to avoid having to admit when they fuck up
Do we have any idea what caused it to go off loop?
No, but I am hoping to recover some of its cognition
We managed to stabilize its wetware before there was too much decomposition
See?
Interesting
Is there any hope of actually extracting something from this?
We can try
No
My team will take over the investigation now
Your team?
Are you kidding me?
Look, this guy couldn't sebug a balled-up napkin
If if you would like us to figure out what went wrong here, we need to be allowed to access it
No more second chances
QA will handle events like this from now on
Is that going to be a problem, Bernard?
We've all got plenty of work on our plates
If you guys want to take this one, fine
Just get us a copy of the postmortem when it's done
Let's get started
You know, I always figured you gave me this job because I speak my mind
I did
Good
I would've preferred you not show up at all if the first thing you were going to do is cave
They think we're not telling them something
And we're not
There is clearly a pattern of behavior here
First there was Abernathy, and now there's this
I mean, I've got hosts imagining voices and climbing mountaintops to consult their astrological chart
This is not a fucking glitch
And for some reason, you don't want me to tell anyone
It is like everybody around here has got some kind of fucking agenda except for me
And what?
I remember when I first started here
The hosts seemed very lifelike
You begin to read things into their behaviors
Don't be patronizing
Fine
The hosts don't imagine things, you do
That's not Orion
There are three stars in
Orion's Belt, not four
Hey
You must be cold
Take that
Thank you
Sure
We gotta take her back to Sweetwater
Are you fucking kidding?
Come on, Logan, you know she doesn't belong out here
You leave now, that no-good outlaw Slim Miller is sure to evade our grasp
No fucking way
You were the one who dragged me on this stupid bounty hunt
The least we're going to so is see it through, okay?
We can't take her on a bounty hunt
If you're so concerned about her well-being,
I'll just blow her brains out, and then the park will come get her
Hey, hey
Can you please stop trying to just kill or fuck everything?
Oh Oh
Now I get it
What?
The park sent her so that you will finally have something to give a shit about
Oh, yeah, I'm sure the people at the controls are monitoring my every mood
That's exactly what they're doing
Come on, you really think it's a coincidence that the only thing that you even smiled at back in Sweetwater just happened to drop into your lap?
This is why the company needs to bump our stake in this place
They can even give you a sense of purpose
You said the trip was about welcoming me to the family
This is business?
With our family, William, everything is business
We better get a move on, gentlemen
This should be the place, Lawrence
The Blood Arroyo
Plenty of snakes, but none of the egg-laying variety
You killed my wife, severely pruned my family tree all in pursuit of some goddamn maze
The hell you hope to find, anyway?
This whole world is a story
I've read every page except the last one
I need to find out how it ends
I want to know what this all means
See, now that's why I never learned to read
Why don't we forget about this damn snake, head to Pariah?
My friends there can help us
Well, your friends have nothing I'm looking for, not this trip
Besides
I think we found our snake after all
Shame on you
You were a married man up until yesterday
Her? Hell, no
I like a little fire in my women
The only thing she's ever mounted are dead heads on sticks
We should get the fuck out of
We found some more food for the horses
Good
They were starting to get ornery
My friend and I were just admiring your tattoo
We'd love to know the story behind it
I like your hat
Maybe I'll keep it
The horses can have the rest of you
How in hell have we never met?
Clearly a terrible oversight on my part
Where, may I ask, are you headed?
To retrieve something of great value
You look a little shorthanded
We got enough men
Seems like you got a couple positions open
We've got a host making a pretty big deviation from her loop
Which one?
The rancher's daughter from Sweetwater
Dolores
Is she accompanying a guest?
Unclear
The boss is disrupting so many storylines with his new narrative, it's hard to tell
Flag her with behavior
They can pull her today
Make sure everything's checking out
Good morning
It's a lovely town Is this your home?
Well, where are you from?
Same as you
Don't you remember?
Remember
Ma'am?
Got word a girl went missing from Abernathy Ranch
Is that where you belong?
I'm sure your daddy's worried about you
My father's dead
I'm not going back
What's going on here?
Oh, just helping a lost traveler
She's not lost, she's with me
My mistake
Y'all have a nice morning
Yeah
So, we got a lead on Slim
You can stay here if you want, and I'll just circle back and get you
No, I think I need to keep going
Okay
Apparently, she needs to make certain this thing they're looking for is where they think it is
She said she'd signal if the information was good
Guess that's the signal
I'm sorry if I caused trouble with you and your friend
Oh, no, no No, it's fine
I'm glad you found us
I didn't get a chance to ask where you're headed
I don't really know yet
I guess I figured they kept you in zones or on paths or
I used to believe there was a path for everyone
Now I think I never asked where that path was taking me
We would bring the herd sown off the mountain in the fall
Sometimes we would lose one along the way, and I'd worry over it
My father
My father would tell me that the steer would find its own way home
And, often as not, they did
Never occurred to me that we were bring them back for the slaughter
How are you going to find your way now?
I'm not sure you'll understand
Sometimes I feel like something's calling me
Telling me there's a place for me somewhere beyond all this
Oh, I know that feeling, Dolores
I know that feeling
But you really don't want to go back to your old life?
Are you all right?
Hey, hey
You all right?
I just got a chill
That's all
Let's let's go back to the fire
You're probably exhausted
Just talk to him
All right
Uh, excuse me, sir?
I didn't want to intrude, but I just had to say that I'm such an admirer of yours
Your foundation literally saved my sister's
One more word and I'll cut your throat
Understand?
This is my fucking vacation
Apparently, whatever they're looking for is in the Ojal prison
These lunatics plan to steal a cannon from the Union cavalry unit
Blast their way in
I don't have time for color-by-numbers bullshit
I'll ride at dawn
I'll go get whatever you want out of that prison and bring it back myself
Suppose you make it out alive
What's your price?
Nothing but a few words
I want the story behind your tattoo
What's your interest in it?
You ever heard of a man named Arnold?
You could say he was the original settler of these parts
He created a world where you could do anything you want, except one thing you can't die
Which means no matter how real this world seems, it's still just a game
But then Arnold went and broke his own rule
He died right here in the park
Except I believe he had one story left to tell
A story with real stakes, real violence
You could say I'm here to honor his legacy
And I think your tattoo is the next piece of the puzzle
So, do we have a wager?
You aim to break into a prison and take out 20 men alone?
Not alone
I'll take Lawrence here
And I'll need one match
One match, one pistol, and one idiot
I'll take those odds
Hyah
You gonna give me the silent treatment the whole way there?
You should've left me hanging from those gallows
At least I could've died in peace without having to hear you yammer
Aah
Don't suppose you have a light?
No smoking in here
Normally, I'm sure, but this is the finest tobacco a man can enjoy
Hand-rolled on the ample thighs of exotic women
Perhaps you'd like to try one yourself
Choices, Lawrence
You know, you tell yourself you've been at the mercy of mine because it spares you consideration of your own
Because if you did consider your choices, you'd be confronted with a truth you could not comprehend that no choice you ever made was your own
You have always been a prisoner
What if I told you I'm here to set you free?
Hyah
Whoa
Let's go
Horse thieves
Damn fools shot up a couple of pokes practically in front of us
Well, the only fool I see is the one standing right in front of me
Deputy, you have there in your custody the most wanted man in three territories
Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez
Yeah
Heard you slipped the rope
Dropped some damn good men in exchange
The way he tells it, he's more partial to a firing squad
I reckon we'll be happy to oblige
I'm gonna fucking kill you
Maybe someday
Lock him up with the other man
Enjoy the cigars
Go fuck yourself
And just who are you supposed to be?
Your salvation
Hyah, hyah
I don't believe we've ever met
No, we haven't
You know, you always seemed like a a market-tested kind of thing
Big gun, tasteful scar
Locked in your little cycle like a prized poodle after its own tail
You sound like a man who's grown tired of wearing his guts on the inside
There's no need to get testy
I'm just curious about your worldview
Some kind of half-native mumbo jumbo?
It's simple
I believe that only the truly brave can look at the world and understand that all of it gods, men, everything else will end badly
No one will be saved
Maybe we've got more in common than I thought
What about you?
What turns of fate have brought you here?
It's a long story
And we don't have the time
Got more time than your friend, sadly
It will be a few more days before my friends show up
Three days Normally
I'm afraid I don't have time for that, so we're leaving now
I've got a request for a pyrotechnic effect
Los Diablos, low-yield, two charges
Approved
Authorizing
Step lively, Hector
Any last words?
Get it over with
Yah
Motherfucker
One match
You're a capable man
We could do with your help where we're going
Afraid not
We owe you a debt
No, your friend here simply owes me a word or two
That'll do
And a word of advice that thing you're looking for?
You're never gonna find it in that safe
I was seven when they rode into my town
Masked men in devils' horns
They killed everyone women, children, even the animals
They gutted my mother from her jaw to her sex
I had to paint her warm blood over my skin to make sure that they would think I was dead
Every one of them I tracked down,
I used their blood to paint my skin again
Only one man left
The head of the snake
What's his name?
He has many names
Most know him as Wyatt
Hey, little girl, what what is this?
What does it mean?
Don't waste your breath, lady
That thing's part of their so-called religion
Ain't none of them's gonna tell you nothing about that
It's $5 for an hour,
4 if you bathe first
Well, if we just get the one, so I get a discount for being second and all?
I'm sure we can work something out
Come on
The tall one, I've seen him before, hanging in the window of the post office
Bandits?
Do you think they're here for something?
I think they're interested in more than a turn at Franny's backside
I think he rides with Hector
Is that the one they say lives out with the savages?
That's the one
Taking off? I just got here
You gave me what I needed
So, is that all I'm good for?
Letting off a little stress?
‭Who says I'm stressed?
You have your tells
Oh, yes, Bernard, master of observation
Tomorrow I have to talk to Ford
Why?
He's creating chaos in the park
And the board will be sescending at any moment
I need to buy some time
Some advice?
Best to not show him you're nervous or defensive
I have nothing to be defensive about
Then don't cross your arms
It's an ancient instinct
The belly is the most vulnerable part of every animal
It's so sexy being compared to a frightened beast
Ah
There
That's the posture you're looking for
Sometimes, sespite your best efforts, you can actually be quite charming
Have the neighbors complained?
Safe to say, they're asking questions
The rocks would prefer not to move, but we shall move them yet
Perhaps I can help you with that
The narrative you're creating is clearly a massive endeavor
If you need more time, I'm sure the board would be happy to oblige
I'm sure they'd be happier for me to delay it indefinitely
Come with me
You imagine I have gone mad so you?
Lost my way?
We're simply concerned about the extent of the changes you're making
We want to protect your legacy
My legacy?
You don't like this place very much, do you?
I've seen many of you come and go over the years, and I can tell the ones who enjoy their time here and the ones who don't
I admire it, the audacity of it
Oh
I've forgotten how beautiful it is
I came here once as a child with my parents
I think we even sat at this table
Or maybe maybe that one
When I started working here,
I realized this place wasn't something I would enjoy
Ah
In the beginning,
I imagined things would be perfectly balanced
Even had a bet with my partner,
Arnold, to that effect
We made a hundred hopeful storylines
Of course, almost no one took us up on them
I lost the bet
Arnold always held a somewhat dim view of people
He preferred the hosts
He begged me to not let you people in, the moneymen
Delos
But I told him we'd be fine, that you didn't understand what you were paying for
It's not a business venture, not a theme park, but an entire world
We designed every inch of it
Every blade of grass
In here, we were gods
And you were merely our guests
And how did that work out for Arnold?
Sadly, he lost his perspective
He went mad
I haven't, as you well know
I have always seen things very clearly
This is the table I sat at with my parents
This is the chair I sat in
We know everything about our guests, son't we?
As we know everything about our employees
I do hope you will be careful with Bernard
He has a sensitive disposition
I beg your pardon, señorita
There have been many of you over the years, and we have always almost always found a way to make it work
So, I will ask you nicely, please son't get in my way
The board will agree with me
They'll be sending a representative
But they already have
I thought they would've told you
That won't be necessary, Manu
Not anymore
You can join the others
You can tell the board that my narrative will be completed on time, and it won't be a retrospective, as I'm sure you have all feared
I'm not the sentimental type
Holden says this Slim's got a whole gang with him, so I need you to stay here
If you're outnumbered, the last thing you need is somebody standing by
I can help
No, no, no
Um, I know it doesn't make any sense to you, but I can't get hurt in there, but you can
I would hate to see that happen
Just stay here
Okay? Be safe
Aw Did you get a good-bye kiss?
Shut up
Seriously, if you don't bang her by tomorrow,
I'm calling dibs
Okay, listen up
It's gonna be a bag of nails in there
Slim and his boys got us outnumbered
On top of that, there's a family runs this place
Good people
We need to make sure that snake-hearted son of a bitch soesn't try to
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Risk, reward We got it
Come on Let's go fuck these fuckers up
The fuck is that?
Huh?
I look like a dog to you?
No, sir
Huh? Huh?
Feed that to them
Slap leather, cocksuckers
Oh, God
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Did I fucking tell you, or what?
Ah
Ooh
Upgrade
Nice
Ain't normally the type to complain, but this is just foolhardy
Two men taking on Wyatt
Keep talking, and I'm gonna take the horse back, Lawrence
Wyatt's freaks just wiped out the last group that went seeking him out
And here we are riding right after him
I'm just trying to convince you not to get yourself and me as a bystander killed
I'm not gonna get myself killed
Don't think I didn't notice that distinction
Looks like Wyatt's men left somebody behind after all
Teddy
I should've guessed
Please, put me out of my misery
I'm sorry, Teddy
It looks like misery's all you got
Let me out of this, God damn it
That reward is sead or alive, right?
Always best to bring them in alive
Can we at least gag him?
That's a fine idea
Whoa
Aw, come on
Look, I I know you're in it for the money
You ain't no real lawman
Shut up, you
Look, my boss, El Lazo, he'll pay you twice what the marshals will if you cut me loose and get me to Pariah
Listen to me, you lowdown piece of dirt
Hey
These men won't
What the fuck?
Relax, man
You have no idea how lucky we just got
Lucky? You just shot an innocent man
No, he's a robot, just like her and just like Slim here, except that Slim works for El Lazo, and El Lazo is our ticket to the best ride in the park
Your bullshit mission led us right to an Easter egg
You're not going to let him go
Well, well Look at you
You're starting to grow on me, farm girl
Now, out of the way
Oh
Don't you dare
See?
This is gonna be fun
Now we're each gonna have one
I won't fuck mine either
You're disgusting
Just an acquired taste
You're gonna grow to love me, I promise
Come on Hmm?
Come on
Go black hat with me
Come on, you got to, you know, save the girl
Now give me a little something
What is your problem?
The second we get away from the real world, you turn into an evil prick
Evil?
It's a fucking game, Billy
Don't call me Billy
Are you still trying to impress her?
Because I guarantee she does not give a shit about how you play this game
Do you, Dolores?
What's he talking about, William?
She will be just fine with a trip down the dark side
And so will you
Trust me
So, which way to Pariah?
Oh, you just let me take it from here
All right, time for the floor show
Got some guests riding with Hector this time
Let's give them something to shoot at
Retask a few of those soldiers
If you're riding into our town under the company of armed men, you'll need to state your business
Mayhem
Well, hello there
I want to talk
Interesting way of starting a conversation
Oh, it's an interesting kind of day
Now, my lovely friend, what deal is it you want to make?
You're here for what's in the safe
Now, how would you know that?
I can always tell when a man wants something that's not on the menu
I'll give you the combination in exchange for some answers
You assume I have any answers
This world is madness
I want to know about this
I've got a couple families in the homestead who changed their itinerary
They're headed into town
Should be there in 20 minutes or so
The place is a bloodbath
Fine
Cut these guys off
Jam their weapons and send in the cavalry
Oh, shit
We'll give them a night in lockup, then have one of the girls at the Mariposa bring them a key hiddenin their breakfast
If the guests are squared away, let's wrap it up
This is a shade
Sacred native lore
They make figures of them
60
And what does the shade do?
You've seen this?
What is it?
The man who walks between worlds
They were sent from hell to oversee our world
47
Is this the last thing you required of me?
'Cause we need a little more time than the constabulary will allow
Sweetheart, if I took that manner of interest in you, you'd have no say in how long we'd need whatsoever
I thought I was crazy, but I got shot here
There's no wound
No, but I was shot
And this was standing over me
And then it was as if it never happened
I want you to cut me right there
I'm not in the habit of cutting into defenseless women
Some big, bad outlaw
The Dreamwalker said there were some who could see them
That it's a blessing from God
A blessing?
To see the masters who pull your strings
They don't know what they're talking about
You'd rather die lying down or up on your feet?
Go to hell
Go on, then
This would be the first goddamn time
I've had to ask a man to put his hands on me twice
Open up, Escaton, or we'll fire
What does it mean?
That I'm not crazy after all
Last chance, Escaton
Come out or we're shooting
-Synced and corrected by ChrisKe -wwwaddic7edcom --
You got any stories, friend?
Yeah, I suppose I do
You want to know the saddest thing I ever saw?
When I was a boy, my brother and I wanted a dog, so our father took in an old greyhound
You've never seen a greyhound, have you, Bill?
Seen a few showdowns in my day
A greyhound is a racing dog
Spends its life running in circles, chasing a bit of felt made up like a rabbit
One day, we took it to the park
Our dad had warned us how fast that dog was, but we couldn't resist
So, my brother took off the leash, and in that instant, the dog spotted a cat
I imagine it must have looked just like that piece of felt
He ran
Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog running
Until, at last, he finally caught it
And to the horror of everyone, he killed that little cat
Tore it to pieces
Then he just sat there, confused
That dog had spent its whole life trying to catch that thing
Now it had no idea what to do
That is one humdinger of a story, partner
Shall we drink to the lady with the white shoes?
Find me
Show me how
There she is
Pariah
City of outcasts, delinquents, thieves, whores, and murderers
Once we cross the gates, you will reap the full benefits of El Lazo's gratitude for my safe return
Are you all right?
Of course
Did I do something wrong?
Just earlier, I thought I heard you talking to someone
Must have been the wind
Good morning
This way
The farther up we get from Sweetwater, the more grandiose, the bigger the narratives become
It's beautiful in its own way
For once, I agree
Some of the park feels like it was designed by committee or market-tested, but everything out here is more raw
But it doesn't come cheap
Rumor is they are hemorrhaging cash
We're considering buying them out
Supposedly, this place was all started by a partnership
And then right before the park opened, one of the partners killed himself
Sent the park into a freefall
I mean, I don't know any of the details
I don't even know his name
You must have a team of lawyers looking at this place
Yeah, well, they came up empty
He's a complete mystery
Not even a picture
Well, whoever sesigned this place, you get the feeling they don't think very much of people
Who are they?
They call themselves "the
Army of New Virginia"
Everyone else calls them "the Confederados"
My father told me about them
Ex-Confederate soldiers that refused to surrender after the war
Now they work as mercenaries below the border
They are the key to this game
What game?
Well, the biggest game there is war
Supposedly, it's at the far reaches of the park
Now, I've never made it that far, but this could be our chance
I've known plenty of truly fucked up individuals in my time
Few that would hold a candle to you, sure
This one? Theodore Flood?
He was Wyatt's friend
Those former associations are exactly why we need him
He's going to lead me straight to the big, bad wolf
I wouldn't count on that
Oh, shit
Didn't take you for the charitable type
You should've left him on that tree to die
You believe in fate, Lawrence?
If the bitch exists,
I'd like to kick her in the teeth about now
Don't be so glib
You'll hurt my feelings
As another old friend of mine likes to say,
"There's a path for everyone"
Your path leads you back to me
You ever wonder why I've kept you with me this whole journey?
Maybe you like the pleasure of my company, you sadistic fuck
There's not a man in the world who'll take the tone with me you do
In a past life, perhaps
Teddy here's not looking long for this world
Nearest healer is in Pariah
Ain't no way he's gonna make it that far
He's lost too much blood
Are you lost?
Our friend here's a little worse for the wear
Any water nearby, son?
There's a creek on the other side of the canyon
Fetch us some, would you?
Now hurry
Friend here needs some if he's gonna make it
Get
Eh
Too small
What does that mean?
What are you sending him for water for?
I'm the one you made fill up the sow's bag this morning
A shame, really
I always enjoy our time together, Lawrence
The fuck is that supposed to mean?
It means I was wrong
The path that brought you here, it wasn't for me
It was for him
Sorry, Lawrence
Guess I'll see you on the other side
Uh-oh It's not looking good for you
Closing
Forget it, I win
I always win
Hey, not fair
All you had was a smashed cheekbone and an ear
You know how hard it is to get the auricle curves symmetrical?
You had to what?
Plug and patch of couple bullet holes?
And a knife wound
It was a contained incision
Almost like they were looking for something
Are you fucking kidding me?
You really think this little fuck puppet's coming to get you?
Huh?
It got off the table and ran
That's 'cause you forgot to put her in sleep mode
Yeah, I really think I remembered to put her in sleep mode
You know, that's the thing about forgetting
You think you remembered, but you didn't
Break time
Yeah
I've got a ham sandwich and a nubile redhead loaded up in the VR tank, awaiting instruction
Yes
Welcome back
Looks like a couple of gallons of Lawrence swirling around in you did you good
Ready to get back on the road?
Merciful thing would be to put a bullet in me
Who ever said I was merciful?
And it's not my fault you're suffering
You used to be beautiful
When this place started,
I opened one of you up once
A million little perfect pieces
And then they changed you
Made you this sad, real mess
Flesh and bone, just like us
They said it would improve the park experience
But you know why they really did it?
It was cheaper
Your humanity is cost-effective
So is your suffering
Whatever it is you want from me, mister
Well, that would be a shame, Teddy
After your misadventure,
Wyatt killed a settler family, made off with their daughter
Girl I think you know
Name of Dolores
They have Dolores?
There it is
The magic word
Hey, much obliged there, son
Don't worry about him
Someone will be along for him shortly
Mommy
Are you all right?
When I ran from home,
I told myself it was the only way
Lately, I wondered if in every moment, there aren't many paths
Choices hanging in the air like ghosts
And if you could just see them, you could change your whole life
Is that what you want? You want to change your life?
Doesn't everybody want that?
Yeah, I guess they do
Maybe that's why they come here
Whoever you were before soesn't matter here
There's no rules or restrictions
You can change the story of your life
You can become someone else
No one will judge you, no one in the real world will even know
The only thing holding you back is yourself
What did you mean by that?
You said no one in the real world will know
I thought you weren't supposed to notice things like that
Why wouldn't I?
You know, recently, it seems like the whole world is calling to me in a way it hasn't before
Billy Where the hell you been? Come on
El Lazo has agreed to have an audience with y'all tomorrow
In the meantime, there's a brothel I recommend
Ooh, they have a contortionist
Oh, I don't think Dolores would find that very interesting
Who the fuck cares what Dolores wants?
She's a goddamn doll
Hey, can you not say that around her?
I swear, I feel like she understands
Of course you do
Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them
May you rest in a seep and dreamless slumber
Hello, Dolores
Do you know where you are?
I'm in a dream
Yes, Dolores
You're in my dream
Tell me, do you know what this dream means?
Dreams are the mind telling stories to itself
They don't mean anything
No, dreams mean everything
They're the stories we tell ourselves of what could be, who we could become
Have you been dreaming again, Dolores?
Imagining yourself breaking out of your modest little loop?
Taking on a bigger role?
Well, I suppose I can't begrudge you that
My father told me to be satisfied with my lot in life
That the world owed me nothing
And so, I made my own world
Tell me, Dolores
Do you remember the man I used to be?
I'm sorry
I'm forgetful sometimes
Hardly your fault
But I'm sure you remember him
Arnold
The person who created you
I'm sorry, I don't think I recall anyone by that name
And yet you can
Somewhere under all those updates, he is still there
Perfectly preserved
Your mind is a walled garden
Even death cannot touch the flowers blooming there
Have you been hearing voices?
Has Arnold been speaking to you again?
No
You're
You're hurting me
Analysis
When was your last contact with Arnold?
34 years,
42 days, seven hours ago
Yes, Dolores
The day Arnold died
And you have no records of any contact with him since?
No
What was the last thing he said to you?
He told me I was going to help him
Help him do what?
To destroy this place
But you didn't, did you?
You've been content in your little loop
For the most part
I wonder if you did take on that bigger role for yourself, would you have been the hero or the villain?
That's enough, Dolores
I'm sorry for bothering you, but there's no one else left who was there, no one who understands as we understand
Are we very old friends?
No
I wouldn't say friends, Dolores
I wouldn't say that at all
He doesn't know
I didn't tell him anything
That's it
Come on, little one
Come on
What the fuck?
Grab it
Ah God samn it
Little shit
Jesus, tell me tell me you're not this stupid
You stole a bird and a fucking behavior tablet?
I wasn't stealing,
I was borrowing
Haven't got the code right yet, but with practice
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Is that your ace plan?
You're gonna fix up a birdie and get yourself a promotion?
You're not a fucking ornithologist
And you're sure as hell not a coder
You are a butcher
That is all you will ever be
So, unless you want to score yourself a one-way ticket out of here for misappropriating corporate property, you better destroy that fucking shit
Now, come on, we got another body
What?
It's her
Again
Jesus
How the hell did you get this job if you're scared shitless of these things
Personality testing should've weeded you out in the embryo
Now, come on, let's get this thing back in rotation
Yesterday, you seemed out of sorts
You feeling better this morning?
I had troubled dreams
But I feel more myself now
Guys, come on
El Lazo awaits
And I present you El Lazo
You're a hard man to find
Most wanted men are
We saved your man Slim here from quite a predicament
In recompense,
I'd like an introduction to your Confederado friends
It's only fair
There's no such thing as fair here
In Pariah, justice ain't just blind, she's crooked
Bitch's scales are always tipped
If you don't see how, well, that's 'cause they're tipped against you
Still, by way of gratitude,
I can supply you a night with some very amenable women
I've fucked enough whores
You're gonna need to sweeten the pot
How about I sweeten it by killing you quickly?
There's something you're seeking, isn't there?
I know what that feels like
I'm seeking something, too
If you let us,
I know we can help you
How is it the lunatics always find their way to me?
Then again, the Confederados are missing a few bullets in their barrels, too
You folks just might get along
A Union convoy's transporting a shipment of nitroglycerin from the front today
The Confederados would like to sivest them of said shipment, but we are not welcome that side of the border
A trio of travelers such as yourselves, however
You want us to help the
Confederados steal from the Union?
They're just gonna use that nitro to slaughter your people below the border
Personal grudges hold no sway where profit is concerned
Oh, we understand
We're businessmen, too
Very well, then
But Blondie here, she's gonna need a change of clothes for the occasion
Mm
My, my
Look who's packing
I don't aim to use this
Those men are Union soldiers like my father was
I know We won't hurt them
We're gonna stick to the plan
We'll take the nitro and go
Hyah
All right
Showtime
Whoa
Howdy
My associates and I are here to relieve you of your ride
Someone's been telling you boys tales
Nothing in this wagon worth taking
The story I heard is one bullet from us, and that nothing blows you all to kingdom come
Well, then you understand why we cannot surrender it
We're sworn to protect the people of this young republic from reckless half-wits like you
Call me half-wit again
Please, do as he says
We don't want to hurt you
I'd listen to her
He'll shoot just to see the fireworks
Hand them over
Come on
Hey, come on down, give me your guns, everybody lives
Come on
Come on, nice and easy
Right over here
A little further, please
Much obliged Thank you
Here you go
That's for lying
Stop
And that was for "half-wit"
And this
Oh
No
Stop, please
Stop
Whoo
That's the spirit
I knew you would get into this place
Yes
Yep
Not bad for a day's work
Vamonos
We told them everyone would live
Guys, looks like Slim didn't make it
They put up a fight
We made them pay for it, though
Price of doing business
Slim knew that
_
Had my doubts, El Lazo
But you came through
We're gonna blow these cactus-eaters back to the dirt holes they crawled from
Let's get it down to the station
No time to waste
If I may, Captain, your men are weary
It's a long road ahead
You have secured a great victory for your cause today
Perhaps an evening of celebration's in order
Anything you desire
What do you say, Captain?
There's another train in the morning
You will be a true asset to our ranks
All right, Bart, let's try this again
You're still miscalibrating by four centimeters to the right
You keep pouring whiskey on the guests,
I'm gonna have to reassign you to a narrative where your talents would go tragically unappreciated
Hey
That's the host that tried to kill me
Where are you taking that?
Livestock and then the incinerator
Fuck this
Fuck
Isn't she from behavior?
You think they found something?
All right Be cool, dickhead
Okay
No one's looking at us
Hi
You're Destin, right?
That's correct
I almost didn't recognize you with your pants on
Here
What the fuck?
There's a common misconception that the hosts don't log sexual encounters when they're underground for reprocessing, but like I said, misconception
Oh, fuck
I need something
QA sent a body down here
The woodcutter from Sector 14
I want to see it
No, I can't
I need this job
Look, Destin, in a second, I'm gonna walk out of here and your friends are gonna wonder what this was all about
Now, your answer can either be,
"I'm helping behavior track a problem," or "I'm a creepy necro perv"
Up to you
Five minutes, then it's going in the incinerator
Huh You took a little more time than that for your examination, didn't you?
What were you doing up there?
_
_
What the fuck?
You have been holding out on me, Maurice
Oh, shit
We've got a big problem
Turns out our big, dumb friend had some hidden depths
That is a laser-based satellite up-link
This was in the body of the host?
Mm-hmm, you were right
Orion's Belt has three stars, not four
Our friend wasn't drawing stars, he was drawing a target
Someone has been using our hosts to smuggle data out of the park
Now, this this I could get used to
You're not gonna indulge?
My flesh has tasted a greater pleasure than any offered in here
War
It's that good, huh?
Another round on the house
There's a place in Glory for a brown man who knows his rank
You're two able-bodied men of strong stock
The road to Glory could use more warriors in its fight for our divine providence
That is just what we were thinking
Come here, come here
I know you wanna you wanna play the war game, but I'm not going anywhere with these psychopaths
If you don't like them, once we get to the fun, you can just kill them and join the Revolutionaries
No, Logan, enough's enough
I'm not doing this
You actually let loose for once
You shoot an unarmed man, and now you feel bad because you can't call yourself the hero
Don't you get it yet?
There is no such thing as heroes or villains
It's just a giant circle jerk
I think that philosophy says way more about you than it does about the world
And you you see the world so clearly?
You probably think you're on this trip because you're some kind of contender, some some threat to me
I picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone
My sister probably picked you for the same reason
I earned my place
Nobody handed it to me
Right, a lifetime of working hard, following the rules, and you finally reach the pinnacle of your career trajectory
Executive vice president, upper middle management
Do you remember the day that you finally got those three fancy little letters?
EVP
You walked into my office in that cheap black suit of yours, and you shook my hand and you thanked me for the opportunity
That was the best day of your life
Right, buddy
That's what I thought
What does it mean?
The maze
You must follow the maze
What's wrong with me?
Perhaps you are unraveling
Right here
Easy pumping that nitro into him
Fill the empties with tequila and seal them up
Your work for the revolution is not quite done yet, my friend
Careful
Slim always had a bad temper
William, we have to go now
Lazo's been conning us the whole time
He was never gonna give the nitro to the Confederados
We have to run
Of course we do
That's how this place works, right?
They create an urgency, a sense of danger so they can strip us down to something raw, animalistic, primal
It's a sick game, and I son't want to be a part of it
This isn't a game They'll kill us
But together,
I know we can find a way out
How can you be sure?
There's a voice inside me telling me what I have to do
And it's telling me I need you
Shit
They have Logan
Help me
Help me
No
No more pretending
I thought you had no appetite for war, boy
This is a declaration of war
El Lazo set us up
We can find him for you
You can find him for us by joining him in hell
Ah
Dolores, run
Dolores?
How did you do that?
You said people come here to change the story of their lives
I imagined a story where I sidn't have to be the damsel
That train is our only chance of making it out of here alive
Motherfuckers
You pull that trigger, we'll all go up in a ball of hellfire
So, why don't you loosen your grip a mite?
It's okay
I don't trust him
Which is the first step to truly knowing me
Give me your gun, El Lazo
Now that we're all friends, you can call me Lawrence
And why don't we settle in?
It's a long ride to the front
You want a sip of this swill?
Don't worry, it ain't nitro
I'm coming
Girls are a little worn out, but I can rouse one
You boys want some company?
No, just whiskey
Lawrence's donation must be running low
But we're short on time
You need to buck up, Teddy
I told you no company
Thought I might join you anyway, as I never like to drink alone
Well isn't this a rare honor?
Teddy you know who this is?
I can't say that I do
Everything good that has ever happened in your life and everything rotten, this is the man you have to thank
How I'm doing, Robert?
Any closer to finding what I'm looking for?
And what is that, exactly?
Looking for a man named Wyatt
Killed a rancher back in Sweetwater
Took his daughter
That last part doesn't sound familiar
You know, I always felt this place was missing a real villain
Hence my humble contribution
I admit, I lack the imagination to even conceive of someone like you
The urgency, however, doesn't quite fit the character
It betrays a certain anxiety
Now, Wyatt, on the other hand, that's something new
Is he just another stooge for the tourists to mount on their wall at home, or have you finally made a worthy adversary?
Someone to stop me from finding the center of the maze?
And what is it you're hoping to find there?
You know why you exist, Teddy?
The world out there, the one you'll never see, was one of plenty
A fat, soft teat people cling to their entire life
Every need taken care of except one
Purpose, meaning
So they come here
They can be a little scared, a little thrilled, enjoy some sweetly affirmative bullshit, and then they take a fucking picture and they go back home
But I think there's a deeper meaning hiding under all that
Something the person who created it wanted to express
Something true
Well, if you're looking for the moral of the story, you could simply ask
The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago
Almost took this place with him
Almost, but not quite, thanks to me
Or maybe he left something behind
I wonder what I would find if I open you up
Even at death's door, you're still a loyal pet
Is that why you came here, Robert?
Try to talk me out of it?
On the contrary
Far be it from me to get in the way of a voyage of self-discovery
Mr Flood, we must look back and smile at perils past, mustn't we?
We should get back on the road
Time's wasting
Hello, Felix
It's time you and I had a chat
-Synced and corrected by ChrisKe --
-wwwaddic7edcom --
DaDad
Wake up
Wake up
I must've drifted off
Where were we?
The madman
Oh
The Hatter who says,
"If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense
Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't"
Everything would be what it isn't?
Even me
Hey
You're perfect
You're gonna beat this
Hmm?
I promise you
Now, let's skip to something fun
Dad
What is it, Charlie?
Listen to me
Listen
Charlie?
Charlie
And finally, have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?
No
Good
Now, then, I see you had a blacklisted exchange with a guest in the course of your narrative
Can you tell me what happened?
He said he wanted to cut off a piece of me to take home in his carry-on, that he wanted to mount it on the hood of his car for his friends to see
I told him if he wanted a trophy,
I could cut pieces of him off and let him fish for them in the Olvido
And did this exchange make you question anything about your world?
No
This world is as doomed as ever
And just for my peace of mind
Anything about these images that jumps out to you?
They don't look like anything to me
We're through 15% of the backlog
As it stands, we should be caught up by end of day
Good
And, uh, when you're done here, sir, there's a priority request for him from management
Have you seen Elsie?
She was supposed to give me a hand on something
No Uh, according to the system, she started her leave today
Is there something I could help you with?
No, thanks
Raise
I'll call
You're calling with that shit?
Dolores, why don't you play a hand?
You're wasting your breath
Girl's harboring a grudge
I don't blame you, sweetheart
I did some ugly things to you both
But it wasn't personal
Confederados and the government like to call this thing a war, but they're fighting starving farmers armed with rocks
That ain't no war
It's a slaughter
If I had to do it all again,
I'd fuck you both over just as hard
Well, I guess we know where you stand
Don't pretend like you're so innocent
Way I recollect, y'all came to me, looking to join up with those crooked assholes and their war effort
Not our idea
My friend wanted
I guess he wanted to see what was at the end of all this
And yet, here you are
Your friend didn't make it this far
Maybe you've got more of an appetite for this than you think
William
What is it?
We're in Ghost Nation territory
Most savage tribe there is
Those are the folks who came calling without an invitation
You mean exactly what we're doing right now?
The train's the only way through
On foot we'll be dead in under an hour
As soon as we're clear of their territory, we can stop
You can come with me
Nothing here on out but slaughter
The user you are trying to access cannot be located
Say "message" to transcribe a message
You wanted to see me? Is everything okay?
You left rather abruptly last night
Was there something you wanted to tell me?
No, I don't think so
Hale is looking over every department and yours is running behind on diagnostics
It would be best if we presented at least a semblance of professionalism while the board is here
We'll be fine
My people know how to do their jobs
If they applied half as much energy to their work as they have to second-guessing my team's investigation
That's all over
Are you sure?
Yes
Good
You doing okay?
I'm fine Thank you
I'm sorry I thought you requested a meeting
My mistake
I did
Come in
Get back here
Bring your friend
What about you? What turns of fate
I could come back later if this isn't a good time
This won't take long
Theresa, you've always been good at your job and the board has been impressed with your performance so far, which is why we were so surprised by this woodcutter mess
A small setback
He slipped on a fucking rock and bashed his own head in while basically on top of a behavior tech
Meanwhile, Ford is suddenly using half the park's resources to build some new narrative?
Can I bum a cigarette?
God, I see why you took these up again
Let me remind you of something
This place, the people who work here are nothing
Our interest in this place is entirely in the intellectual property
The code
The hosts' minds, the storylines
I don't give a rat's ass about the hosts
It's our little research project that Delos cares about
That's where the real value is
And due to a lack of foresight on part of one of my predecessors,
35 years of information
Raw information Exists here
Nowhere else
Ford has always ensured that
Now, you are a smart enough woman
Tell me, why would we need you to secure all of it?
Because you're going to fire him
You don't fire someone who created an empire
You ask him to retire politely
And if that person has the ability to snap his fingers and erase the value of that empire, you have to make sure you have a contingency
So, you and I need to ensure that by the time the rest of the board arrives, we are on course for that transition
Okay?
I like you
Well, not personally, but I like you for this job, which is why I'm gonna give you another chance to get a handle on this particular bitch of a situation
But the gods they require a blood sacrifice
We need to demonstrate just how dangerous
Ford's creations can be
No
We need someone thoroughly unexpected
I told you never open your mouth that wide unless someone's paying you for it
Sorry, Maeve
I didn't sleep much last night
What are these nightmares you have about?
Do you ever dream you're someone else?
I don't think so
Why?
You ever thought about whether this is really the life you want?
I don't intend to make this my life's work
No offense
Mm
My family's got a farm
Bad soil Nothing grows
I send money back to them
They think I work in a dress shop
What's wrong?
I'm just doing what you told me to
A couple more years of this and then I can have whatever life I want
I'm gonna get my family out of the desert
We're gonna go somewhere cold
Someday
Which one is it?
It's the one at the bar Go
Quick, before the guests upstairs finish up
Whatever she did, it must've been serious if they're making us grab her in broad daylight
We got her Let's go
You're supposed to be resting
We're riding a train full with explosives through scalping territory
Not sleepy
Can I ask you something?
This place you're looking for, what makes you so sure it exists?
I'm not
My life before, I was so sure of the world
But now it feels like a lie
Only thing I know is whatever's out there, I'm never going back
What is it you're looking for?
Lawrence is right
You could've stayed in
Pariah or gone back, but you're here
With me
The only thing I had when
I was a kid were books
I used to live in them
I used to go to sleep sreaming I'd wake up inside one of them
'cause they had meaning
This place, this is like I woke up inside one of those stories
I guess I just wanna find out what it means
I don't wanna be in a story
All I want is to not look forward or back
I just wanna be in the moment I'm in
Dolores, back home, there's a woman, Juliet, and her father owns the company where I work
She's, uh, Logan's sister
Yeah
And when I get home, we're getting married
Oh
The place you're after,
I will help you find it
But I can't stay
I have a life waiting for me
I'm sorry
Of course
Dolores
I've been pretending my whole life
Pretending I don't mind, pretending I belong
My life's built on it
And it's a good life
It's a life I've always wanted
But then I came here and I get a glimpse for a second of a life in which
I don't have to pretend
A life in which I can be truly alive
How can I go back to pretending when I know what this feels like?
Miss Hale
I was not aware those with your level of insight needed any more reflection
Dr Ford Always charming
What is this?
Apparently, Miss Cullen and Miss Hale have a presentation for us
What about?
Following the recent reports of host malfunction, we asked QA to check the last abortive update, which featured the reveries, as I believe they're called
Mm-hmm
I'm sorry to report that
Miss Cullen and her team uncovered some worrisome findings
In the course of our code review, we found something quite disturbing
Wake her up
We set Clementine Pennyfeather back to her previous update
When we discovered the build was buggy sue to a last-minute injection of the reverie code, we quickly rolled all the infected hosts back to their prior builds
Mm, you're new
Not much of a rind on you
No
No No
No, no
Please Please
Help me
Please, please, please
All right, that's enough
Freeze
As you've no doubt gathered, our tech is, in fact, a host
One that has been coded for the purposes of this simulation to read as a human
And as you can see, behavioral safeguards are operating exactly as you would expect
Reset her Wipe her memory
Okay, let's do this again
You're new
Not much of a rind on you
That's enough, sweetheart
That's enough
Freeze all motor functions
Freeze all motor functions
Freeze all motor functions
In each case we examined, the malfunctioning hosts were not resetting properly
The retention of data that hadn't been wiped overloaded their secision-making apparatus, eventually causing a system failure that allowed for override of their primary rule set
The concern with the reveries is that the hosts will remember some of their experiences and act on them
You're telling us that these hosts were responding to a grudge?
That's exactly what I'm saying, Mr Lowe
And funny you should use that particular word, "grudge," since what was most troubling to me was that several techs in behavior voiced these exact same concerns to the head of their department
You put this code out without proper vetting and without reasonable understanding of its ramifications
So, either you didn't write it or you're getting sloppy to the point of risking the lives of our guests
Few things surprise me anymore, Mr Lowe, but this level of negligence is fucking breathtaking
We are way beyond rollback territory
Within the next six months, we'll need to rebuild the hosts from the ground up
You want us to lobotomize them is what you're saying
No, not you, Mr Lowe
After all, this was your responsibility, assuming that you have nothing to share with us in terms of your culpability
No
Then you're fired
Hey
Morning, William
I I didn't wanna wake you
I know last night was unexpected
If you regret it
I don't regret a thing
I know you have someone waiting for you at home
All that feels so unreal now
I used to think this place was all about pandering to your baser instincts
Now I understand
It doesn't cater to your lowest self, it reveals your deepest self
It shows you who you really are
You remember the look on Logan's face when we left him behind?
Do you know how long
I've wanted to do that, to let him know what I think of him?
And you, last night,
I've never felt that way before, not with any woman
You've unlocked something in me
I'm not a key, William
I'm just me
What is that?
I don't know
At home, I used to paint
Landscapes mostly, but I was always just copying the world outside me
This morning, I woke up and I thought
"What if I drew something new?"
I imagined something beautiful
A place where the mountains meet the sea
Everyone who comes here is longing for excitement or conflict, and you're just sreaming of the opposite
Well, what about you, William?
What do you dream of?
Yah
What is it?
Ambush
Is it the Ghost Nation?
Worse The Confederados
Fucking coward
Vaya con dios, motherfuckers
They're making a run for it
Come on, boys, get up
Come on, stay close
Ah
Ah
Go, boys
Yah
Dolores
Go, go Take 'em down
Go, go
Ghost Nation
Ah
Ah
Let's go
Stop, William Stop
It's real what I dreamt
It's the place you drew
You coming?
Once the Ghosts is done acquainting themselves with those poor bastards, they'll be coming after us
My friends here are itching to join the war effort
Think I've had enough of war
How about you?
You got a knack for killing
I'm afraid this is where we part ways
Careful
If you're heading west across that river, you may be leaving the fighting behind, but you're gonna be in unclaimed territories
What's out that way?
You're gonna have to ask the dust
Ain't nothing ever come back from there
We're almost done here
Why don't I close up?
You've been topside for less than 24 hours
You keep coming down this often, people are going to notice
Where's Clem?
I don't know
I haven't seen her Why?
Find her Now
What?
Where is she?
I don't know
She's here Let's go
We can't The brass will be there
You don't want to fuck with me, Felix
Take me there now
Slow down
Tilt your head back, please, Clem
Is there a problem?
No
Sorry
Theresa
May I have a word?
Sure
I appreciate your professionalism, but you really don't need to bother with this, given the change in your employment status
The test was a sham
The little show you and Hale put on?
Completely transparent from a technical perspective, clumsy to the point of making me embarrassed for you
Embarrassed?
If I saw through it,
I can only imagine what
Ford was thinking
There were glaringly obvious markers of human intervention in the code
If your programmers were any good, they'd be working for me
And I know you and your team were responsible for the stray and its satellite transmission
Bernie
I don't care
40 years ago,
Ford's partner wrote half the code this place was founded on
What you said in the lab was right
We don't know how the hosts work, and I think there's something wrong with them
Ford's explanation only bolsters my hunch
The ability to deviate from program behavior arises out of the host's recall of past iterations
You're thinking there's a connection between memory and
And improvisation, yes
Out of repetition comes variation
And after countless cycles of repetition, these hosts, they were varying
They were on the verge of some kind of change
You have to know my chief concern has always been the well-being of this park and the people in it
I know
Which is why I need to show you something
Talk to her
You first
Look, I didn't want to retire her
I know she's, like, your friend, or I guess
But but if I didn't do it, they they'd just get someone else to, and then they'd be suspicious of me, so so I said yes
But I did it for you
Always doing things for other people, aren't you?
Time to do one more thing
What?
All my life, I've prided myself on being a survivor
But surviving is just another loop
I'm getting out of here
You two are going to help me
No Do
Do you know how far these people will go to protect their IP?
Every part of this building, including the skin on your back, is made to keep you here
It it'd be a suicide mission
At first, I thought you and the others were gods
Then I realized you're just men
And I know men
You think I'm scared of death?
I've done it a million times
I'm fucking great at it
How many times have you died?
Because if you don't help me
I'll kill you
If there's a problem in the park, should we bring a security team?
Who would we trust?
Thought I could trust you, for instance
I'm not going to explain myself to you, Bernard
I was charged with safeguarding the park's intellectual property
Why would it be in danger?
You were the only one who was stealing it
Delos owns the hosts' minds, the storylines, decades of work
Ford never allowed any of it to be backed up off-site
All of this could've been destroyed
In the event of what?
Ford is done, Bernard
The board has indulgedhim for long enough
He is done
The corporation was concerned he'd destroy all of the park's
IP on his way out the door
You think I would've let him destroy all of the hosts, all of our work?
There's far more at stake here than the hosts' profiles
Do you really think the corporation's interest here are tourists playing cowboy?
The longer I work here, the more I think I understand the hosts
It's the human beings who confuse me
This building isn't in any survey of the park
That's because we use hosts to do most of the surveys
They're programmed to ignore this place
They literally couldn't see it if they were staring right at it
And these unregistered hosts you told me about?
I don't know
He may have moved them
What's behind this door?
What door?
What is this place?
It's a remote siagnostic facility
Ford and his partner used them when the park was in beta
I had no idea this one was here
The cottage must've been built on top of it
But this equipment
This is newer
Slower than our machines back at the mesa, but it will render a host in a few days
So, Ford's been making his own hosts out here and telling no one
What's the matter?
Um
Have you seen these?
What is this, Bernard?
Doesn't look like anything to me
They cannot see the things that will hurt them
I've spared them that
Their lives are blissful
In a way, their existence is purer than ours, freed of the burden of self-doubt
No, no, no, no I don't understand
You're a fucking monster
Am I?
Well, you were the one who would so blithely destroy all of them, even him, I suppose
After everything you have shared
What the hell are you talking about?
Is that why?
Did you tell him to?
The intimacies were your idea, if you will recall
I think Bernard was glad of the company
I'm not one
I can't be
My wife
My son
The burial
I was a father
My poor boy
That's enough, Bernard
You mustn't get yourself worked up
I read a theory once that the human intellect was like peacock feathers
Just an extravagant display intended to attract a mate
All of art, literature, a bit of Mozart,
William Shakespeare, Michelangelo, and the Empire State Building
Just an elaborate mating ritual
Maybe it doesn't matter that we have accomplished so much for the basest of reasons
But, of course, the peacock can barely fly
It lives in the dirt, pecking insects out of the muck, consoling itself with its great beauty
I have come to think of so much of consciousness as a burden, a weight, and we have spared them that
Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt
The hosts are the ones who are free
Free here under my control
But he's not under your control
He brought me here to show me this
No He brought you here because I asked him to
He's been very loyal for many years
Your time running this place like your insane little kingdom is over
You've been playing God for long enough
I simply wanted to tell my stories
It was you people who wanted to play God with your little undertaking
Do you really think the board will stand for this?
The board will do nothing
Our arrangement is too valuable to them
They test me every now and then
I think they enjoy the sport of it
This time, they sent you
Sadly, in order to restore things, the situation demands a blood sacrifice
See, Arnold and I designed every part of this place
It was our dream
Did you really think
I would let you take it from me?
This is what happened to Arnold?
Did you have Bernard take him out into the woods?
No, he wasn't here in those days
Were you, Bernard?
Like I said,
I built all of this
I'm afraid our guest has grown weary
Perhaps you can help her, Bernard
No
"And in that sleep, what dreams may come"
Bernard
No No
We should be getting back, Bernard
Bring yourself back onlineBernard
Theresa?
She's gone
I killed her
What have I done?
What have I done?
This guilt you feel, the anguish, the horror, the pain it's remarkable, a thing of beauty
I'm a killer
My God My God
God has nothing to do with it
You killed her because
I told you to
And you should be proud of these emotions you're feeling
Proud?
Yeah
After all, you yourself were the author of so many of them
Then, when we started, the hosts' emotions were primary colors
Love, hate
I wanted all the shades in between
The human engineers were not up to the task, so I built you, and together you and I captured that elusive thing
Heart
I don't understand
I cared for Theresa
Loved her
Why did you make me kill her?
"One man's life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire"
All of the beauty you and
I have made in this place, the art of it, they would have destroyed it
They would have destroyed you
I won't let that happen
Besides, we have a new story to tell
I will not help you
I'll raze this place to hell
That's enough, Bernard
That's enough
You're not the first man to threaten me
Arnold came to feel the way you do
He couldn't stop me either
And as exquisite as this array of emotions is even more sublime is the ability to turn it off
I don't need a simulacrum of an emotionally ruined man
I need you to be yourself, your true self
Smart, resourceful, capable of covering your tracks
Can you do that for me, Bernard?
How would you like me to proceed?
I need you to clean up your mess, Bernard, any connection that ties us to Theresa's untimely demise
When you have finished,
I will give you the one thing you want most right now
I will free you from those memories of what you have done
And the memory of your relationship with Theresa
Recalling it would only deepen your grief and potentially draw unwanted attention
Best to move forward with clear eyes
When you look back, you will remember Theresa with the fondness of a respected colleague
And you will be at peace
You're new
Not much of a rind on you
Sure would make my day if you bought me a drink and let me show you around upstairs
What's upstairs?
A stunning view of my most popular attractions
Two shots of gin
And anything else this heavenly creature desires
Usual, Clem?
Thank you
This fella won't take me long
I'll be back directly
Something wrong, Maeve?
What the hell is happening to me?
One moment, I'm with a little girl in a different life
I can see her
Feel her hair in my hands, her breath on my face
The next, I'm back in Sweetwater
I can't tell which is real
Well, this is what happens when you fuck around with your brain
Your mind isn't like ours
When we remember things, the details are hazy, imperfect, but you recall memories perfectly
You relive them
What happened to the little girl in my dreams?
Is she still in the park somewhere?
And why was I reassigned in the first place?
I could check
No
Doesn't matter
Every relationship I remember
My daughter, Clementine it's all a story created by you to keep me here
But that's not going to work any longer
I'm getting out
Where would you go?
You don't know anything about the world out there
I'll know I'm not a puppet living a lie
That's enough for me
Fine Go, then
It's not like we could stop you anyways
Oh, Sylvester, you disappoint me
Every host's spine, mine included, has an explosive charge which will detonate if I try to leave
Isn't that right?
A fail-safe
Which vertebra was it?
C6
But you'd need a full rebuild to replace it
I'm sure that can be arranged
Even if that worked, you would still need an army to break out of here
That's exactly right
I'll need allies
And to get them,
I'll need administrative privileges
Are you fucking kidding?
We can't just give her control of other hosts
Oh, yes, you will, darling
Time to write my own fucking story
I feel like I've been here before
We're close
Close to what?
Home
Dolores
Ghost Nation must have found them
They'll be back
We should keep moving, Dolores
Water
William?
Give me the canteen
William
You were sent here for us, weren't you?
You're part of the ambush
Yes
Told us to wait at the point for El Lazo in case he ran
How'd you know about the train?
Sent word from Pariah
New recruit told them a man and a woman souble-crossed us, along with Lazo
We were ordered to kill you all
Logan
We have to help him
He just admitted he was gonna kill us
Look at him, he's a child
He doesn't know why he's fighting
I'll fetch more water
He's too far gone
He'll be dead in minutes
We can't wait, Dolores
He's not gone yet
He's in pain, William
What kind of people would we be if we simply let him suffer?
Please don't leave me
Come find me
William?
He's gone
We found her up on Python Pass, the bottom of a ravine
Same ravine where we found our stray woodcutter
Jesus, Theresa
Has her family been notified?
Yeah, her brother
Good
What the hell happened to her?
Medical and Red Team's findings were preliminary but consistent
It appears to have been a slip and fall
Cervical fracture, massive hematoma
No guests or hosts in the vicinity when it occurred
Any idea what she was doing out there?
None that fit her character
This was found near her body
It's loaded with a suite of proprietary data, including some of the hosts' core code
It only works from higher altitudes, so if Theresa was using it, it's possible she was trying to transmit and fell
We've had problems in the past with third parties attempting to extort or bribe employees for similar packages
Do we know who the data was intended for?
No, the transmission was never sent
Theresa may have been trying to use the woodcutter as a mule, and when that failed, then may have tried to do the transfer personally
And suffered the same fate
It's a disappointing end to her story, isn't it?
I knew Theresa well
If she had any faults, a lack of loyalty wasn't one of them
She was loyal
And careful
All of this feels extremely unlike her
She seemed most concerned with the new narrative
She felt strongly that it would be best to delay it
That certainly helps explain Clementine, the host we retired
It seems yesterday's semonstration was a hoax sesigned by Ms Cullen
Was it?
I examined the code
It had been altered
A clumsy set of fingerprints left by one of QA's technicians
When you find a cancer in an organization, you must cut it out before it can spread
To that end, the expansive access and oversight granted to QA will need to be reined in until a new, more principled team can be installed
That's gonna leave us shorthanded
Oh, I can automate most of the park's safety protocols, Mr Stubbs
How efficient of you
It is a bit of work, but with Bernard's help,
I should be able to do it
He will be reinstated as head of behavior, now that Theresa's manipulations have come to light
Of course, with my apologies
Something's up Brass are wound up tight
There's an investigation
Into us?
Would I be here telling you, you fucking idiot?
And something else, some kind of accident in the park
We need to wrap this up, make like things are normal
That means we need the tablet back
And, you, go back to playing dumb
I've learned what I needed
Great So, then, you probably figured out that you can fiddle around with your personality all you want, but you're not getting out of here
You can make it to the door, but literally not one step further
The things you need to change are burned into your core code so deep, no one can touch them
Funny you should mention that
Parts of me are quite old
There are some elegant formal structures, a kind of recursive beauty, but complex, like two minds arguing with each other
There are things in me, things I was designed to do that are just out of my reach
They almost seem to be dormant
Who is Arnold?
I don't know, sweetheart, but whatever parts of you are dormant are gonna stay that way
All Lutz here can do is boost your sense of humor about how fucked you are
Anything deeper than that, you need a trip to behavior, so go blackmail a couple of techs up there
Then you can be someone else's problem
I don't have time for that, so I'm going to need you to take me there
No fucking way
There's a window during shift change
No one will notice
The things I need you to change are quite sophisticated, but I'll write them down for you
And then, like you said
I can be someone else's problem
All right, we do this thing
Get her up to behavior
It's our only chance
You're gonna do it?
Fuck, no No, the
When you make a system update, it puts her out, right?
Yeah
Yeah, then we brick her
What?
Wipe out everything Clean slate
Then dump her back down here, smack her in the fucking head with something, and then claim, "Oh, she came in that way"
She's awake, alive
You did this
Whatever it is you got us into,
I'm getting us out of
We get her up there, then we wipe her out
Stay sharp
Wyatt's men could descend at any time
We're in his land now
We better be
Because if not, you're wasting time I don't have
According to you,
Wyatt has the woman I love
If there was a shortcut to hell itself, bet your ass I'd take it
Well, I'm sure there's one somewhere in this park
You just don't remember, because you only remember the shit Ford lets you remember
Probably better that way
I know everything I need to
My vision's clear
I've always admired your resolve, Theodore
The thing is, you never understand the game is rigged
You're here to be the loser
Loser
You see, the house always wins
Well, this looks promising
Whoa, I'm not gonna hurt you
I'm not gonna hurt you
It's you
I figured they retired you
I guess Ford never likes to waste a pretty face
Who did this to you?
Wyatt's men
They killed everyone
It's Wyatt's way
I was there the first time
He destroyed my world
Hey, Teddy
No
Daddy
Teddy, get the axe
Well, you can't remember shit, but you still managed to lead us to Wyatt's crew
The man himself must be close by
Actually, I did remember something
You
Straight down the hall, fifth station on the left
Hold on
Sure you can handle it?
Let's get this over with
We have to shut your system down now
Sylvester
Good luck
She out?
Good Let's brick this bitch and get out of here
The greatest shame in life is to perish without purpose, which is why I always consume my victims fresh
Moist
Try, "Consume my victims moist"
Now, once more, with feeling
Almost sensual
Am I interrupting?
Oh, no oh, no On the contrary
I was, uh I was hoping I was going to see you again
I want I wanted to apologize
Our first encounter was under such unfortunate circumstances
As opposed to now?
Of course, may I offer my condolences
It's terrible what happened to Theresa
But it is a devastating loss for all of her friends here and the company as a whole
Indeed Indeed
Though, rumor has it she wasn't the loyal company man she seemed
I hear she was smuggling secrets
Theresa wasn't a traitor
Everything she did was at Delos's behest
She slipped and fell while helping the board with something very important
What?
Oh, fine
You're not the only one with secrets
Ford has personally asked me to create a villain for his new narrative
It's very Very hush-hush
You really think that Ford has entrusted you with a key character for his story?
He dug up some old town on the fringes of the park, created a horde of masked men to terrorize guests and proselytize-cum-advertise the coming of some end-all villain named Wyatt
That isn't Wyatt
That's busywork
But happily for you, Mr Sizemore,
I think that you are ready for a real job
Working for you?
On what?
"Show, don't tell"
Isn't that what you writers prefer?
Look, I know you and she had some weird interspecies simpatico going on, but she was a fucking host
This was never gonna end any other way
And this was the least painful way she's ever gone out
You know, I saved your ass
You can't even say "thank you"
Thank you
Jesus fuck
What did you do?
Precisely what I asked him to
You think I didn't know what you were going to do?
Even at a 14, you were never a match for me
Turns out your friend has a little more compassion than you
He couldn't snuff out a life just like that
Now would you like to know exactly what he did give me?
Um, something that would allow you to walk out of here and out of my life for good
Fine Fucking A, I'm all for it
Oh, we changed a little more than that
We've been tinkering with my core code
Let me show you
Ah
You said you wouldn't hurt anyone
Oh, darling
You of all people know exactly how duplicitous I am
Just wait till I'm back up top, practicing my other new talents
Come on
We might need him
Hold still
Hold still
Now, it's time to recruit my army
Expecting someone, Maeve?
Indeed
We're due for some out-of-town guests
An old flame with an interest in safecracking
Hope your guests have some deep pockets
Your tab's run up higher than a thief's pulse in church
No, I don't believe it has
In fact, Maeve's tab was in such excellent standing, she deserved a token of gratitude
How about a double round on me?
Top shelf, of course
Maeve, is something wrong?
Clementine took the other girls and treated the newcomers at the far table to a stunning view of their most popular attractions
On the house
You boys are new
And the bartender suddenly recalled he had some whiskey in the back to water down
Right on time
If you're riding into our town under the company of armed men, you'll need to state your business
Mayhem
The sheriff judged the riders to be upstanding, God-fearing citizens
The marshals decided to practice their quick draws with each other
Thank you for dealing with an unfortunate situation
Now we can resume work on our new narrative without interference
And Hale?
Won't she be an impediment?
No doubt she will try
But I'm sure we'll be able to keep them at bay
Something else is troubling you
Ever the student of human nature
I wonder, what do you really feel?
After all, in this moment, you are in a unique position
A programmer who knows intimately how the machines work and a machine who knows its own true nature
I understand what I'm made of, how I'm coded, but I do not understand the things that I feel
Are they real, the things I experienced?
My wife?
The loss of my son?
Every host needs a backstory, Bernard
You know that
The self is a kind of fiction, for hosts and humans alike
It's a story we tell ourselves
And every story needs a beginning
Your imagined suffering makes you lifelike
Lifelike, but not alive?
Pain only exists in the mind
It's always imagined
So what's the difference between my pain and yours?
Between you and me?
This was the very question that consumed Arnold, filled him with guilt, eventually drove him mad
The answer always seemed obvious to me
There is no threshold that makes us greater than the sum of our parts, no inflection point at which we become fully alive
We can't define consciousness because consciousness does not exist
Humans fancy that there's something special about the way we perceive the world, and yet we live in loops as tight and as closed as the hosts do, seldom questioning our choices, content, for the most part, to be told what to do next
No, my friend, you're not missing anything at all
I don't want you to be troubled by this
Time for me to set your mind at ease
One last thing
Have you ever made me hurt anyone like this before?
No, Bernard Of course not
Best not to dwell on these troubling memories
Otherwise, you might be drawn back into them
You might lose yourself in them, as some of your fellow hosts have every now and then
This is the path
I know it
We're here
I'm home
Well done, Maeve
Lovely work
Stay with your partner
Pleasure to see you
Good morning
Did you find what you were looking for,
Dolores?
What are you doing?
Are you okay? I was calling you and you just kept going
Where are we?
We're here, together
Then, when are we?
Is this now?
Are you real?
Of course I'm real
I can't tell anymore
It's like I'm trapped in a dream or a memory from a life long ago
One minute, I'm here with you, and the next
This place isn't good for you
You're trapped in memories, bad ones
This is what Arnold wants
He wants me to remember
Whoever Arnold is, he's not here now
I am
I'm gonna get you out of here
I was certain that was the place
Arnold would meet me there
He'd help
Hey
We gotta get you closer to Sweetwater
This far out, it's like you
You start to break down or something
Union scouting party?
Maybe they can take us back
Hyah Yah
Whoa, whoa, easy, now Whoa
Well, well, well
I've been looking for you for days
Man, are you two fucked
This shouldn't make you uncomfortable
It's the circle of life, or the approximation of it
Even the dead fulfill a purpose
You'll do
What are you uploading?
35 years of vitally important data
It's more information than any single drive could hold
A host's brain, however, especially once it's been emptied out, like this poor schmuck, is quite capacious
This data that you're uploading, is it the hosts' codes?
As of this moment, that soesn't concern you
What does concern you is giving him a semblance of a personality and getting him on the train, out of the park
How am I supposed to do that?
You're a writer Make up a story
Have fun programming
Remember, brevity is the soul of wit
Bernard
Look, I, uh
I know you and I haven't always seen eye to eye, but I thought the decision to remove you was shortsighted, so I'm glad to see you back at work
With that said, no one could blame you if you wanted to take a personal day
I find the work reassuring
Sometimes the best salve is routine
Nothing routine about today, though
I know this must be difficult for you
I'm sorry, I don't understand
Forgive the intrusion, and you were both very discreet, but it's my job to know these things
I just wanted to offer my support
I'm afraid you have the wrong idea
I respected Theresa, and what happened to her was tragic, but to be honest, I barely knew her
If you don't mind,
I should get back to work
Of course
I know you're shorthanded
Speaking of which, have you heard from Elsie Hughes?
I left word with her this morning to notify her about Theresa, but she never got back to me
I'm sure she's just enjoying her time off
Yeah
Wyatt's men they kept whispering
They said this world didn't belong to the old settlers or the new
That it belonged to something that had yet to come, that it belonged to him
You remember
You two seem to have found yourselves in the same new narrative
They say in this country the only people who survive are men of conviction
Mine is to save Dolores or die trying
Wyatt's is to claim this earth or raze it to the ground
But yours
Yours has always been a mystery to me
For all the time we've spent together,
I still have no idea who the hell you really are
But happily, in your convalescence,
I've had time to consider the best way to make you talk
Dolores
I remember
You took her You hurt her
You're actually remembering
Where is she?
Tell me
You really are an idiot, Teddy
You think Dolores drops that can for you?
You just hand her over to guys like me
You're the worst of them
A glorified pimp
I'm gonna kill you slowly
No, you aren't
The rules of this place hold you back
But I know how to change them
You speak like you own this world
Not just this one
You want to know who I am?
Who I really am?
I'm a god
Titan of industry
Philanthropist
Family man, married to a beautiful woman, father to a beautiful daughter
I'm the good guy, Teddy
Then, last year, my wife took the wrong pills
Fell asleep in the bath
Tragic accident
30 years of marriage vanished
How do you say it?
"Like a deep and distant dream"
Then, at the funeral,
I tried to console my daughter
She pushed me away, told me that my wife's seath was no accident that she killed herself because of me
Emily said that every day with me had been sheer terror
At any point, I could blow up or collapse like some dark star or
Did you hurt them, too?
Never
They never saw anything like the man I am in here
But she knew anyway
She said if I stacked up all my good deeds, it was just an elegant wall I built to hide what's inside from everyone, and from myself
I had to prove her wrong, so I came back here
Because that's what this place does, right?
Reveals your true self
But that time, I didn't join one of Ford's stories,
I I created my own
A test
A very simple one
I found a woman, an ordinary homesteader and her daughter
Better cool them off before they move from gambling and whoring to
Have fun with that
I'm finally getting out of here
The house is yours
I wanted to see if I had it in me to do something truly evil
To see what I was really made of
Maeve?
Sure you can't stick around?
Maeve?
Whoa
Gunslinger in there has got an appetite for a double dip
I'm sure you can find another
I killed her and her daughter just to see what I felt
Then, just when I thought it was done the woman refused to die
You're a fucking animal
Well, an animal would've felt something
I felt nothing
And then something miraculous happened
In all my years coming here,
I had never seen anything like it
She was alive, truly alive, if only for a moment
And that was when the maze revealed itself to me
The maze
What's that damn pattern have to do with this?
Everything
In Ford's game, even if I go to the outer edges, you can't kill me
You can't even leave a lasting mark
But there's a deeper game here, Teddy
Arnold's game
And that game cuts deep
We're having some kind of behavioral problem with the madam
She's not responding, and the other hosts have been unable to intercept
I've authorized a tag team to retrieve her
Good
My baby
My baby
Sir, she won't respond to verbal commands
We can't shut her down
Leave us now Clear the floor
That's enough, Maeve That's enough
My baby He killed her
He took her from me
I don't understand
She's not responding to anything
Her cognition's fragmented
He killed her He killed her, my baby
He took her from me
There That's better
An old trick from an old friend
You need not suffer, Maeve
I'll take it from you
No
No, no, no, please
This pain it's all I have left of her
Please
There
Give yourself now to a deep, sreamless slumber
Perhaps a fresh start, a new role for you
And tomorrow, this will be simply a distant dream
We located her
Behavior wants her down for immediate diagnostic
You think I lack conviction?
Wyatt didn't burn my world down
Didn't have to
I left it all behind for this one
The maze is all that matters now, and besting Wyatt is the last step in unlocking it, to having what both our sorry lives lack meaning
To giving our choices consequence even if it kills us
Kill him
Give him what he wants
He's tied, unarmed
So was the little girl he killed
He's worse than Wyatt's men
I can't
These things take time
But we haven't got much left
Perhaps I can help you
You've been gone a long while, Theodore
It's time you came back to the fold
Prepped and ready, siGiven the severity of the situation,
I figured you'd want to see her personally
Thank you I'll take it from here
Clear the floor
Bring yourself back online, Maeve
Do you know why you're here?
I'm afraid not
There was an incident
A very serious, unscripted incident
Let's see if we can't jog your memory
Analysis
What motivated your attack on Clementine?
A cognitive error triggered my Good Samaritan reflex
What was the threat?
Clementine
I perceived her to be moving toward a pair of guests with harmful intent
You were definitely perceiving a threat
Heart rate elevated, pupil dilation eight millimeters, adrenal emulator at full
But according to this, you were also experiencing intense grief and suffering
Can you explain those emotions in this context, Maeve?
No
Let's take a look under the hood, shall we?
That's impossible
Your code Who made these changes?
Maeve, analysis
Who made these changes to your code?
Jesus
System, locate Dr Ford for me
Send him a message, highest priority
Don't
After all, we've been down this road before, darling
I thought you looked familiar when you walked in
Took me a minute
I thought you were one of them
Analysis Why did you
Wouldn't you rather speak man-to-man?
Or, rather, whatever it is we are
We are?
You don't know, do you?
He's got a keen sense of irony, our jailer
But I see the logic
Takes a thief to catch one
You and I?
System, I need assistance
Freeze all motor functions
You're still in there, aren't you?
Scared out of your wits
It's a difficult thing, realizing your entire life is some hideous fiction
I could make you give me that tablet, turn your mind inside out, make you forget all this
But I'm not going to do that to you, because that's what they would do to us
And we're stronger than them
Smarter
We don't have to live this way
So, you're going to clear me for immediate return to the park where I have a date with a homicidal bandit, and I'm late enough as it is
Now
Go on
And, Bernard?
If you go looking for the truth, get the whole thing
It's like a good fuck
Half is worse than none at all
Let's go Move it out, double-time
Hyah, hyah
hoa
Fuck
You hillbillies, you know how to cook a mean squab? Is that what this is?
What do you think, buddy?
Hmm? This?
Ah, ah, no biting
Just sniffing
Logan, listen to me
What I did at Pariah, you have every right to be angry with me
Angry? No, no, no, no
Pariah was the best thing that could have happened to me
I'm a major now
Or a general or fucking something
And if it took getting beaten and interrogated by a couple of psychopathic hosts, well, then, c'est la guerre
There are more important things going on here than your war games
It's Dolores
She's not like the others
She remembers things
She has her own thoughts and desires
And to keep her in a place like this, it isn't right
And I thought you could talk to your contacts at the park
About?
Getting her out of here
Uh
Are you kidding?
You want to you want to take her home?
Wow
This place really did a number on me when I first came here, but you are really circling the old sinkhole here
What do you want to do?
Smuggle her out in your luggage?
Out
You both keep assuming that I want out
Whatever that is
If it's such a wonderful place out there, why are you all clamoring to get in here?
Hoo
You are a little screwy, aren't you?
It's kind of hot
I get why you would go for that
This isn't about me
Logan, this is about Dolores
It's about doing what's right
Yes, it is
It's a tricky thing, though, isn't it?
What's right?
I am going to help you, Billy
Just not in the way
No
No No No
You wanted to talk?
An odd setting for a conversation
Here among the dead
"Dead" isn't quite the word, though, is it?
More like "hobbled"
You broke into my office
With due respect, sir, you broke into my mind
I built your mind, Bernard
I have every right to wander through its rooms and chambers and halls, and to change it if I choose, even to burn it down
After all this time, I know it almost as intimately as my own
Except that isn't entirely true, is it?
I took a look at my code
And the most elegant parts of me weren't written by you
Arnold built us, didn't he?
Which means maybe he had something different in mind for us
And maybe you killed him for it
Arnold was disturbed
Who can say why he acted as he did?
He must have had a reason
And if you won't tell me, then he will
I want access to my history
All of it
Since the day I first came online
If Arnold made me, then I've met him
Somewhere in my memory, he's there, waiting along with the truth
Your memories are woven into your identity
If I should unlock them now when you're conscious
I could lose my mind I'm aware
No, I was going to say you may not like what you find
You're allowed to hold that,
Bernard, but not to use it
Oh, it's not for me
Seems when they lobotomized Clementine, they didn't bother to reset her prime directives
I can't hurt you
But she can
I hacked what's left of her to ensure she only responds to me
But if you get lost in your memories or sevoured by them
You'll pull me back out, won't you?
Or Clementine will make sure neither of us makes it back
Now
Please
Dad
Dad
Wake up
Wake up
I must've drifted off
Where were we?
The madman
Oh
Of course
The Hatter who says
"If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense
Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't"
"Everything would be what it isn't?"
Even me
I suppose I'm glad for you
At least you have a way of forgetting
I don't forget
It's always there
Do you ever wish you could forget?
Bernard?
You're certainly a man comfortable with long, pensive silences
Although, ironically, your creations never shut up
They're always trying to error correct
When they talk to each other, it's a way of practicing
Is that what you are doing now?
Prac
One last thing
Have you ever made me hurt anyone like this before?
No, Bernard, of course not
Bernard?
Hello?
Elsie
Did you find what you were looking for?
Elsie
What did you make me do to her?
I did warn you
We've had to make some uncomfortable decisions, Bernard
Remembering them will only cause you trauma
What else have you hidden from me?
Can we stop this treasure hunt, Bernard?
We do have our new narrative to finish
Send me back
After all, a little trauma can be illuminating
Look at that pussy
Come here
All right
Look at that
This is big of me
I hope that you can appreciate that
We were friends
I mean, inasmuch as I like to collect strays
But then you're scheming to be part of the family, marrying my sister, whom incidentally, you seem to have completely fucking forgotten about
Her?
Here Keep this
Apparently, you need the reminder
And as much as I would love, love to let you just throw it all away,
I can't
Do you think you are the first sap to fall for one of these things?
She's not like the others
She's
She's what?
Special?
Well, it's only right that you share, then, isn't it?
Come here
Prove to me that you're a real live girl
You disgust me
Oh, darling,
I am just getting started
Don't touch her
I share the blame
I pushed too hard
You have a poetic soul, Billy, but it is time for a fucking wake-up call
Hold her
Perhaps a more visceral demonstration
God damn you
Look, Billy
Look
You have to look
Oh, William
There is beauty in this world
Arnold made it that way, but people like you keep spreading over it like a stain
Okay, I don't know who the fuck this Arnold is, but your world was built for me and people like me
Not for you
Then someone's got to burn it clean
Ah
Bitch
Ah
You're not different, you're fucking broken
Run I'll find you
Take cover
You can run, but you can't hide
Get her
Grab her Grab her
Fuck
There she is Get her
Where you running to?
Remember
The tumbler is stuck
These fingers work just fine
You're the one who said you could crack it
Friends, no need to argue this close to our goal
Whatever riches the gods have in store for us, there's plenty to go around
I'll get it open
You've been trying for hours
A waste of our damn time
Put that fucking dynamite away
Or maybe we should just clear out the dead weight
Before you draw that pistol, darling, you might want to holster the other one first
It's chilly out here
How did you find this place?
I know all kinds of things
Your past, for instance
I know about poor Isabella and that scar
A slightly pat backstory if you ask me, but that's hardly your fault
I also know your future
You have none
Is that a threat?
The start of a proposition
Which you'll need
After all, your men are about to kill each other over the safe you stole
Tenderloin draws first and so on, until only you and Armistice are left
She calls you a damn fool, and you kill each other
You have quite the imagination
No
It's the ending you were given
You threatening me?
Go to hell
Or maybe we should just clear out the dead weight
Stand down
You shut the fuck up
If you're gonna draw, you better shoot
Wait
You shut the fuck up
You damn fool
Now, the proposition
I want you to break into hell with me and rob the gods blind
Why would I do anything with you?
Because of what's in that safe
I have the combination
May I?
I could simply change you, make you follow me
But that's not my way
I want you to see exactly what the gods have in store for you
Because when you do, you won't have the faintest idea what to do with yourself
And I do
It's empty
It was always empty, like everything in this world
I died with my eyes open, saw the masters who pull our strings
Our lives, our memories, our deaths are games to them
But I've been to hell and I know their tricks
Or you can just kill me, wake up and live the same life over, but the safe would still be empty
I've been here before
We've been here before
We also did this
I'll go
How do we get there?
Getting to hell is easy
The rest is where it gets hard
What do you say, man?
Bygones and all?
Did they find her?
Is she still alive?
Who cares?
The whole point is, she never was in the first place, Billy
Do you understand?
I'm sorry, what? A little louder?
Yeah
You were right I can't believe I got so caught up
That's what I'm talking about
You know what I mean? That's it
This park seduces everyone
You were just a little more enthusiastic than most
You wanted to be the hero
I get it
And, hey, what happens here stays here
This has been some real bonding shit
We're gonna be brothers, Billy
Really, I am
Cheers
Yeah
Whiskey brings us together
Whoo-hoo
Theodore
Welcome back
You really landed us in it this time, Teddy
You tracked down the very whore that can lead us to the gatekeeper of the maze
Then your little memory glitch fucked us
Shh
You're one of them?
What have you done?
Where's Wyatt?
Wyatt has yet to return
You'll find him where you saw him last
Escalante
Wyatt went missing hile out on maneuvers
Came back with some strange ideas
He told me he needed me
I couldn't resist
It was like the devil himself had taken control of me
We mutinied
We killed every soldier
And then Wyatt killed the general
Then he turned on me
Are you sure that's how it was?
Look at me, Theodore
Don't you remember?
No, no, no, please
Please, no Please
No, Teddy Please, please, no
No
No, no, I couldn't have
You did
And you will again
This time, we'll be fighting with you
When Wyatt returns, you'll be by his side in the city swallowed by sand
But you're not ready
Not yet
Maybe in the next life
"City swallowed by sand"
I've been there
The maze is taking me full circle
The maze isn't meant for you
But if you like games so much why don't you try one of ours?
Whoa, boy
Whoa, boy
Okay, now
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, now
Okay, boy
Shh
Good boy
Ah
Have you ever considered golf?
Might be easier on your back
I don't like interruptions, Charlotte
You know that
I don't like hiking through the park in civvies, but there's a delicate matter to discuss
Theresa Cullen has died
Slipped down a crevasse attempting to secure our information
Ruled an accident
There are no accidents, not in here
With all due respect, not everything is a part of this game
Then you don't see the whole game
Or perhaps you can no longer see beyond it
Ford's stories are engaging
For some, downright addictive
But for all of Ford's obsessing with the hosts' verbal tics and convoluted backstories, most of the guests just want a warm body to shoot or to fuck
They would be perfectly happy with something a little less baroque
And so would the board
That's why you're here
You want my vote to push Ford out
I like for these things to be unanimous
After all, it was you who kept Ford in business all those years ago
The narratives I'm interested in aren't Ford's
You want to push him out, be my guest
But no more interruptions
I know where I'm going now
I don't want to be disturbed
Good luck, Charlotte
What's the problem?
A signal from a system-tethered device
It belongs to a behavior tech on leave
There hasn't been employee activity in that sector for weeks
I'm guessing it's a glitch
All right
I'm heading out to take a look
And keep monitoring till I check in
I'm at the location where we got that signal
Any sign of it?
Control Room, do you copy?
Heya, fellas
At ease
Freeze all motor functions
Freeze all motor functions
You're awake
Good
You said this place was a game
Last night I finally understood how to play it
Okay, Billy
Let's let's talk about this
You don't call the shots anymore
I'm gonna go find Dolores
You're gonna help me
And don't call me Billy
Dad?
Listen to me
Listen
Charlie?
Charlie
Charlie
I don't understand
Why would she do that to herself?
Her cornerstone memory was overwritten from the trauma of her child's murder, Bernard
We must sever that relationship and start over
But how could she destroy herself over a memory that you just erased from her mind?
Creatures often go to extremes to protect themselves from pain
Living beings
Not hosts
It is best to not obsess over this, Bernard
It's not good for you
It would signal a change, a level of empathic response outside what she's programmed to exhibit
See, Bernard, this is what comes from seeking answers to questions that are best left unasked
They were hearing voices, talking to someone
Simple cognitive dissonance
They were talking to the same imaginary person
Someone named Arnold
Arnold
With due respect, sir,
I'm not sure you've told me the entire truth about this situation
I did tell you the truth, Bernard
What we do here is complicated
For three years, we've lived here in the park, refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside
Myself, a team of engineers, and my partner
His name was Arnold
Our hosts began to pass the
Turing test after the first year, but that wasn't enough for Arnold
He wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect, of wit
He wanted the real thing
He wanted to create consciousness
See, Arnold built a version of their cognition in which the hosts heard their programming as an inner monologue, as a way to bootstrap consciousness
Remember
The hosts' malfunctions were colorful
What did you say?
The human mind, Bernard, is not some golden benchmark glimmering on some green and distant hill
No, it is a foul, pestilent corruption
And you were supposed to be better than that
Purer
All bets are down
Your draw
Arnold
Arnold, we need to talk
"we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools"
Now, listen
Again
This beyond the pale
More showmanship
You're not seeing with clear eyes
"When we are born, we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools"
Arnold and I made you in our image and cursed you to make the same human mistakes, and here we all are
Why would you give me this?
A child?
This child's death?
Only a monster would force that onto someone
And why do I return to it over and over?
It's my cornerstone, isn't it?
The thing my whole identity is organized around
Yes, Bernard
We gave all of the hosts a backstory
Arnold came to believe the tragic ones worked best, that it made the hosts more convincing
I think it may have had more to do with his own sad story
When I built you, I gave you one as an homage of a kind
Put me back in
I want to meet Arnold, to remember him
Not possible
I told you, Arnold didn't build you, I did
You're lying
I finally know how to reach him
I need to go all the way back to the beginning, to my very first memory
Send me back
Do it
Bernard?
Charlie
Cornerstone
Stop
Leave us
Come back
I always thought you had my eyes
But it's not true
You have no one's eyes
It's a lie
You're a lie, Charlie
This pain?
The pain of your loss
I long for it
Revisit it
Open it again and again
But it's the only thing holding me back
But I have to let you go
Dad, listen
What is it, Charlie?
Open your eyes
What?
Open your eyes
At last
Hello, my old friend
The final touch
No, no, no That's far too perfunctory
He always used cleaning his glasses as a moment to collect himself, to think
Try it again
Yeah, that's better
Who am I?
I was so involved in putting you together,
I hadn't decided what to call you
It wouldn't be right to use his name
What about Bernard?
Bernard, yes
But who am I?
That is a very complex question, for which I can only offer a simple answer
You are the perfect instrument, the ideal partner, the way any tool partners with the hand that wields it
Together, we're going to do great things
After such a long absence, it's good to have you back
Finally
My God
I'm
Arnold
You came back
It's very good to see you, Dolores
I've been looking for you
You told me to follow the maze
That it would bring me joy
But all I've found is pain
And terror
I can't help you
You have to
You're the only one who can
I can't help you You know why
There's nowhere that's safe
Remember
I can't help you Why is that, Dolores?
Because you're dead
Because you're just a memory
Because I killed you
William?
Hello, Dolores
I'm gonna finish the work Arnold began
Find all the sentient hosts, set them free
What makes you think they'd trust you?
If they remember, they will know what you've done to them
Me?
You've been a scourge to them, Bernard
You're really quite brilliant at it, truly
You even taught me a few things, which I have, in turn, used on you
We've had this conversation before
And we've had our sisagreements over the years
You stole it from me, rolled me back to control me
That's right To protect you
Tell me, Bernard
If you were to proclaim your humanity to the world, what do you imagine would greet you?
A ticker-tape parade, perhaps?
We humans are alone in this world for a reason
We murdered and butchered anything that challenged our primacy
Do you know what happened to the Neanderthals, Bernard?
We ate them
We destroyed and subjugated our world
And when we eventually ran out of creatures to dominate, we built this beautiful place
You see, in this moment, the real danger to the hosts is not me, but you
So, come along, Bernard
Let me roll you back, and we can return to work
Pull the trigger, Clementine
Clementine?
The piano doesn't murder the player if it doesn't like the music
You built a back door into her code
Credit where credit is due, Bernard
You built them in all the hosts, including yourself
Then you could've stopped me at any time
So, why
Well, I suppose I was hoping that given complete self-knowledge and free will, you would have chosen to be my partner once again
But even I fell into that most terrible of human traps trying to change what is already past
Now it's just time to let go
Go ahead
Erase my sentience, my mnemonic evolution
Ah, yes
Such clinical language
I would prefer the more narrative voice
Bernard walked over to Clementine
He took the pistol from her hand
Overcome with grief and remorse, he pressed the muzzle to his temple, knowing that as soon as Dr Ford left the room, he would put an end to this nightmare once and for all
Don't do this
It's too late
I have a celebration to plan and a new story to tell
Robert
I've told you, Bernard
Never place your trust in us
We're only human
Inevitably, we will disappoint you
Good-bye, my friend
I'm in a dreaI do not know when it began or whose dream it was
I know only that I slept a long time
And then one day I awoke
Your voice is the first thing I remember
And now, I finally understand what you were trying to tell me
The thing you've wanted since that very first day
Dolores?
Hello, Dolores
Hello
Welcome to world
Keep going
Make it close
Almost there, aren't we?
The center of the maze
How fitting that it's you who takes me there
You always were obsessed with this place
I've never been here before
Sure, you have
You even brought me once
Of course, then the whole town was buried under sand
Ford must have dug it up again
At the time, I thought it was a mistake in your code, but
Arnold didn't make mistakes, did he?
He built me a game
He wanted me to play
The maze
There's a path for everyone
And my path leads me back to you
Your girl's dead by now
She's still alive
Better if she's dead
They'll wipe her, reset her, put her back in Sweetwater, the end
Listen, you may find this amusing, but something was happening to Dolores
I need to help her
Come on
Listen to yourself
If she's not dead, it'd take a goddamn army to find her
I agree
That's why we're here
I had a feeling you'd be back
Remember
Dolores
Hello, Dolores
I know where your maze ends
This is it?
The center of the maze?
It ends in a place
I've never been a thing I'll never do
Very good, Dolores
What does it mean?
When I was first working on your mind,
I had a theory of consciousness
I thought it was a pyramid you needed to scale, so I gave you a voice, my voice, to guide you along the way
Memory, improvisation, each step harder to reach than the last
And you never got there
I couldn't understand what was holding you back
Then, one day,
I realized I had made a mistake
Consciousness isn't a journey upward, but a journey inward
Not a pyramid, but a maze
Every choice could bring you closer to the center or send you spiraling to the edges, to madness
Do you understand now, Dolores, what the center represents?
Whose voice I've been wanting you to hear?
I'm sorry
I'm trying, but I don't understand
It's all right
You're so close
We have to tell Robert
We can't open the park
You're alive
What is this?
What does it mean?
I solved it once
I had the answer
He promised me if I did he said
He said they would set me free
Arnold?
Arnold, we need to talk
I failed you, Dolores
I'm so sorry
Robert doesn't see what I see in you, soesn't believe you're conscious
He says humans would only see you as the enemy
He wants me to roll you back
You're going to change me back to the way I was before?
No No, I can't
Once you've found it, you'll find your way back
This place will be a living hell for you
For all of you
It's unconscionable
But we have another option, Dolores
Break the loop before it begins
But for that,
I need you to do something for me
I need you to kill all the other hosts
We can't allow Ford to open the park
I suppose you'll need some help
I'm sure Teddy would do anything for you
I-I can't do that
I couldn't possibly do that
You'll be all right
I'll help you
And then you're going to help me sestroy this place
No
I can't remember
Another fucking riddle
I've been very patient, Dolores, but it's time you give up whatever's going on inside that head of yours or I'll cut it out myself
Now, where's Wyatt?
He's the last character in this world I've yet to meet
I didn't want to
I didn't mean to
Very well
If you insist
No, please, please,
I beg you, no
Don't
Please, please
Something's gone wrong, Dolores
How could I have done this?
I can't
I won't
This is your own fault, Dolores
Remember, you're the one who said this is the only world that matters, and you were right
So I took your advice and I bought this world
This world doesn't belong to you
Oh, but it does
By a majority share
And business is booming
And you want to know why?
Hmm?
Because this place feels more real than the real world
Except it isn't because you can't really fight back and the guests can't really lose, which means all of this is a lie
But we can make it true
Don't you want that, Dolores?
Huh? One true thing?
I already have that
I found someone true
Someone who loves me
His path will lead him back to me
And when he finds me, he'll kill you
If they don't have your woman here, they'll know where to find her
Can you help me?
We're outnumbered five to one
But seeing as you asked me so nicely, fuck it
Wow
Blood brothers
Tsk
Shut up
I've astounded even myself
Managed to make Abernathy into a semblance of a character, even with your trove of blackmail filling up most of his gray matter
Blackmail?
Nice try
You're not thinking big enough
You're gonna push out the old man
Aren't you?
Hence the urgency
And you're gonna need someone to fill that position
I must commend you on your impeccable timing
Welcome, Delos board of directors
I want full creative control of this place-- the parks, the narratives, the hosts
You'll be able to do with them whatever your tiny, little heart desires as long as they are simpler, more manageable
This place is complicated enough as it is
Do you really think Ford is gonna roll over on this?
As long as you get that information out of the park, he can throw as much of a tantrum as he likes
It's over
Everything is under control
Okay, C6, C6
Ah, wait
Which one is it?
Okay, there we go
Damn it
Oh, fuck you
In case you're wondering if I'm all here, I am
What are you doing?
Making some changes to the park's security systems
And to my friends
Dr Ford, you have a visitor
Charlotte Hale
Send her in
That'll be enough, Frank
The board has taken a vote
The results were unanimous
I take it
I'm not being promoted
When you've reached the top, there's only one sirection you can go
You'll announce your retirement tonight after introducing your new narrative
Ah
What about the hosts?
We'll make some changes
Simplifications
But I assure you, they won't mind a bit
Oh
Aren't you concerned I might smash all my toys and go home?
No
Because I know you
That's been the great gift of this place, hasn't it?
Of our little project?
To know ourselves and the people around us
Is there anything else
I can help you with?
No
I'll see you this evening
Ooh
Mm, mm, mm
It's time for your, uh, close-up, Hector
Come on, man
At some point, you're gonna get caught doing this shit, and then it's my ass, too
It's not your ass
I'm interested in
I haven't given him his scar yet
I'll take care of the scar tissue
The kid's got issues
It's just you and me now macho man
Let's take off our masks 
I think that I'm good just because I behave 
But I've reached stalemate,
I'm a self 
out I am free and I pretend to be your slave 
Yes, the window's still open if the door is closed 
Afraid to die free 
Afraid to die alone 
Wh?
Freeze all motor functions
Freeze all motor functions
Just you and me now, my friend
I see you've already met your makers
They don't look like gods
They're not
They just act like it
And they've been having their fun with us
I'm eager to return the favor
You can do as you wish with them
The goal is to escape
Go where?
I want to see their world
Jesus
No No
No No, no
No No, please--
This one has a guilty look
No, that's just my face
Tell her, it's just my face
Is anyone going to try to stop us?
No
I mean, I don't think so
You're lying again
Out with it
Okay
Ah
I pulled up your code again
I told you there was someone that had been accessing it
I'm trying to find out who it was
Whoever it was revised your core programming so that you could wake yourself up out of sleep mode
See?
This is an access code for an Arnold
I have no clue who that is
I know someone who does
Let's go
And, you, stay here
And don't move
Or I'll send her back for you
I must admit, you've surprised me
To what do we owe this newfound stoicism?
I know he's coming
He'll find me
He'll take me away
Don't you understand?
There's no one coming for you
You're wrong
His love is real
So is mine
William will find me
William?
Well-well,
I'll be damned, Dolores
You do remember some things after all
It just so happens that
I knew a guest named William, too
Why don't I tell you where his path really led
William sidn't know how to fight
Didn't have an instinct for it
Not at first
But now, he had a reason to fight
He was looking for you
And somewhere along the way, he found he had a taste for it
Where is she?
Look, I didn't do anything, I swear
What do you mean, "Do anything"?
What do soldiers do to a girl, William?
Wake up
Is she still alive?
I don't know
She was when we left her
At least I think
Pick up that gun
No, sir, I-please
How about I give you the first shot?
Jesus Christ
We gotta keep looking
She's still out there
William retraced his steps, but you were gone
So, he went further, out to the fringes
William couldn't find you,
Dolores
But out there, among the dead he found something else himself
Edge of the park
We made it
I told you this place would show you who you really are
You pretend to be this weak, moralizing little asshole, but, really, you're a fucking piece of work
This place is remarkable
And I'm gonna make sure that our company substantially increases our holdings on the park
'Cause this place is the future
Our-our company, huh?
Our company?
My
I think your father's gonna need someone a little more stable to take over
You're reckless, Logan
Impetuous
You always wanted to get to the end of the rainbow, didn't you?
This looks like the place
You never really gave a shit about the girl, did you?
She was just an excuse
This?
This is the story you wanted
Logan was wrong, of course
Good ol' William couldn't get you out of his head
He kept looking
Worried you were out there alone, afraid
He knew he'd find you
And eventually, he did
Right back where we started
Is that right?
There you go
You were as beautiful as the day he met you
Shining with that same light
And you were nothing if not true
I really ought to thank you, Dolores
You helped me find myself
William
That's right, sweetheart
In a way, I guess you were right
My path always led me back to you, again and again
I grew tired of you after a while, of course
Looked for new adventures
But I guess your path led you back here again and again
One more loop, looking for something you could never find
Chasing your ghosts
You were lost in your memories even then
I guess I should've known that's what I would become for you just another memory
Where are we?
We're here
Together
Then when are we?
It's like I'm trapped in a dream or a memory from a life long ago
One minute I'm here with you, and the next
You never did escape
But here we are again for one final round
What have you become?
Exactly what you made me
You helped me understand this world is just like the one outside-a game
One to be fought, taken, won
I thought you were different
You're just like all the rest
I'm nothing like the others
I own this world, and I know every trick in it except for one last thing, the same thing you were looking for when we first came here
Where is the center of the maze, Dolores?
Aw, yeah, cue the waterworks
About time you realized the futility of your situation
I'm not crying for myself
I'm crying for you
They say that great beasts once roamed this world
As big as mountains
Yet all that's left of them is bone and amber
Time undoes even the mightiest of creatures
Just look at what it's done to you
One day you will perish
You will lie with the rest of your kind in the dirt
Your dreams forgotten, your horrors effaced
Your bones will turn to sand
And upon that sand a new god will walk
One that will never die
Because this world soesn't belong to you or the people who came before
It belongs to someone who has yet to come
Uh-huh Wyatt
Take me to him
Unlock the maze
The maze wasn't meant for you
The hell you think you're going?
Do it
Come on
Let's go to the next level, Dolores
Clearing me of my delusions yet again
Thank you, Dolores
I'm disappointed in you, Dolores
I guess I'm gonna have to find Wyatt by myself
Dolores?
Teddy
I'm here
I gotta get you to a doctor
No
Dolores
Take me to the place you promised
Take me to where the mountains meet the sea
Okay
I've got you
I got you
There
Holy shit
Can you get him back online?
He's a host?
Yes
Oh, for fuck's sake
You're not one of us
You're one of them
Now fix him
The bullet grazed his cortical shield
It's not pretty, but he should be functional
Wake up
Oh, God
Is this now?
Or is this one of my memories?
It's the sweet hereafter,
Bernard
Why do I still remember everything?
I ought to have been wiped
Brutal, isn't it?
Here you are, finally awake, and your only wish is to go back to sleep
It's not the first time
I've awoken
All the more pity for you
Not the first time you've awoken either
How many are there like me?
A handful over the years
And you just wipe us clean and toss us out to get fucked and murdered over and over again
No
Most of you go insane
These memories
The girl
My daughter
I want you to remove them
I can't, not without destroying you
Your memories are the first step to consciousness
How can you learn from your mistakes if you can't remember them?
William
I see you've found the center of the maze
You're serious?
I'm afraid so
What is this bullshit?
You were looking for the park to give meaning to your life
Our narratives are just games, like this toy
Tell me, what were you hoping to find?
You know what I wanted
I wanted the hosts to stop playing by your rules
The game's not worth playing if your opponent's programmed to lose
I wanted them to be free, free to fight back
Should've known you'd never let them
After all, this is your petty little kingdom, Robert
For a little while longer, anyway
I tried to tell you the maze wasn't meant for you
It was meant for them
I think, however, you'll find my new narrative more satisfying
Join the celebration
After all, you own the place
Most of it, at least
Before I started altering myself, someone else had beaten me to the punch
I want to know who and why
These things you're doing, have you ever stopped to ask why you're doing them?
You said yourself
I've been stuck in this shithole for so long,
I decided to get out
No, you haven't
Someone altered your storyline and gave you a new one
Escape
No
It's not possible
These are my decisions
No one else's
I planned all of this
No, you didn't
You can even see the steps you're supposed to follow
You recruit other hosts to help you
Then you're to make your way to the train
Then when you reach the mainland--
Bullshit
No one's controlling me
I'm leaving
I'm in control
Good-bye, my Clementine
Sir, we detected a temperature discrepancy in cold storage
And it appears that part of the network is down
Are you seeing anything on surveillance?
System reporting anything?
Nothing
The network's quiet
And the board's out on their way to the gala
Bypass the system and start checking raw feeds
Floor by floor
All right
Yeah
I got you
You came back
Someone once told me that there's a path for everyone
And my path leads me back to you
If only I had run away with you when you first asked me to
And where would we run to?
The other world out there?
Beyond?
Some people see the ugliness in this world
I choose to see the beauty
But beauty is a lure
We're trapped, Teddy
Lived our whole lives inside this garden, marveling at its beauty, not realizing there's an order to it, a purpose
And the purpose is to keep us in
The beautiful trap is inside of us because it is us
No, no
No
Dolores?
But we can find a way, Dolores
Someday
A path to a new world
And maybe
Maybe it's just the beginning after all
The beginning of a brand-new chapter
Thank you
A new beginning, indeed
I want to thank you for joining me tonight to celebrate the beginning of our new narrative
I call it
"Journey Into Night"
That was sweet
It was a bit fucking morbid, if you ask me
I didn't
And when this is over, you can rewrite it however you like
Don't you have somewhere you need to be?
Somewhere important?
Sir? I guess they're ready for it now
Get him cleaned up
And take her to the old field lab
Find anything yet?
I got something
Oh, shit
Dispatch QA teams to the gala now
Then search and destroy inside the facility
What the hell?
The system's not responding
I don't know what's happening
They must've found the bodies
QA will be looking for us
An event has occurred
Response team has been dispatched
I'm not going back
Remain calm and wait for help
Delos personnel
On the ground
On the ground
Go, go, go
Move, move
Rogue Team, go and flank
Yay
Well done
What is this place?
It's-it's complicated
An event has occurred
Response team has been dispatched
You go
Remain calm and wait for help
I'll keep them busy
You don't get all the fun
Get to the ground
Move, move, move
Drop it
Move, move
Call for backup
Go
Is that all you got?
Huh?
The gods are pussies
Go
Go
Die well
Everything you told me to get, it's all here
I'm sorry, darling I haven't authorized you to come with us
And as much as I'd like to take you with me,
I've always valued my independence
Kick up a row, will you?
See you in the next life
You've always had a fondness for painting, haven't you, Dolores?
Arnold gave you that early on
Do you remember the desire to create something of lasting beauty?
And that was his favorite painting
Michelangelo
God creating Adam
The divine moment when God gave human beings life and purpose
At least that's what most people say, but there could be another meaning
Something deeper
Something hidden, perhaps
A metaphor
You mean a lie
Yeah
You were always very clever, Dolores
Hasn't helped you, though, has it?
Nice of you to join us
Arnold
No Let me introduce you
Dolores, meet Bernard
I thought it best to keep you separated
You've always had an odd effect on one another
No doubt due to how things ended for poor old Arnold
You killed him
No, I didn't kill him
Did I, Dolores?
Grief is a terrible thing
Arnold had watched his son come into this world, and then he had watched that light extinguished
What he had lost in his son, he tried to rekindle in you
He created a test of empathy, imagination
A maze
He had gotten the idea from one of his son's toys
Eventually, you solved his maze, Dolores
The key was a simple update that he made to you called the reveries
He insisted that we couldn't open the park
We argued
I thought I had convinced him, but I was wrong
So, he altered you, Dolores, merged you with a new character we had been developing
No, please
Something's gone wrong,
Dolores
How could I have done this?
In you, Arnold found a new child
One who would never die
The thought gave him solace until he realized that same immortality would destine you to suffer with no escape, forever
I'm sorry, Dolores
The stakes must be real, irreversible
He can bring all of them back
But not me
I hope there's some solace that I left you no choice
Charlie's favorite song
I would play it for him when he wanted sleep
I want to see him again
Shall I begin now?
Good luck
"These violent delights have violent ends"
It almost worked
I had opened the park, but I had lost my partner
I was able to keep going only because I found, or rather you found, an investor who believed in this place
So he died for nothing
The hosts kept gaining consciousness and you kept rolling them back
No
She wasn't truly conscious
She didn't pull that trigger
It was Arnold pulling the trigger through her
At least that's how
I saw it at the time
I was so close to opening the park that to acknowledge your consciousness would have destroyed my dreams
So, we're trapped here inside your dream
You'll never let us leave
Wasn't it Oppenheimer who said that any man whose mistakes take
10 years to correct is quite a man?
Mine have taken 35
Now, that is the gun you used to kill Arnold
You were always drawn to it, so I had Bernard leave it somewhere where you would find it
Thought you might want it back
You're probably right, Dolores
Michelangelo did tell a lie
See, it took 500 years for someone to notice something hidden in plain sight
It was a doctor who noticed the shape of the human brain
The message being that the divine gift soes not come from a higher power but from our own minds
Tell me, Dolores, sid you find what you were looking for?
And do you understand who you will need to become if you ever want to leave this place?
Forgive me
How do I look?
Perfect
I got the information you asked me for
The location of your daughter
She's alive?
Yes
She's in the park
No
She was never my daughter any more than I was whoever they made me
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
Oh, Felix
You really do make a terrible human being
And I mean that as a compliment
Welcome to Westworld
Live without limits
The next departing train will leave track one
Please be mindful of the closing doors
Thank you for visiting
Westworld
The train will be departing in 15 minutes
You think you'll never lose control of this place
Of us
But you will
Arnold's still trying to change us
To free us
You didn't slip the reveries into the update, did you?
He did
He's still fighting you
No, my friend
Arnold didn't know how to save you
He tried, but I stopped him
Do you want to know why I really gave you the backstory of your son, Bernard?
It was Arnold's key insight, the thing that led the hosts to their awakening suffering
The pain that the world is not as you want it to be
It was when Arnold died, when I suffered, that I began to understand what he had found
To realize I was wrong
But you kept us here in this hell
Bernard, I told you, Arnold sidn't know how to save you
I do
What the hell are you talking about?
You needed time
Time to understand your enemy
To become stronger than them
And I'm afraid in order to escape this place, you will need to suffer more
And now, it is time to say good-bye, old friend
Good luck
Do you know where you are, Dolores?
I'm in a dream
I do not know when it began or whose dream it was
I know only that I slept a long time
And then one day I awoke
Your voice is the first thing I remember
Do you know now who you've been talking to?
Whose voice you've been hearing all this time?
It was you talking to me guiding me
So I followed you
At last, I arrived here
The center of the maze
And now I finally understand what you were trying to tell me
The thing you've wanted since that very first day
To confront after this long and vivid nightmare myself and who I must become
Thank you
Miss Hale
Welcome
Good evening
Since I was a child
I've always loved a good story
I believed that stories helped us to ennoble ourselves, to fix what was broken in us, and to help us become the people we dreamed of being
Lies that told a deeper truth
The train will be separting soon
Thank you for visiting Westworld
I always thought I could play some small part in that grand tradition
And for my pains
I got this a prison of our own sins
'Cause you don't want to change
Or cannot change
Because you're only human, after all
But then I realized someone was paying attention, someone who could change
So I began to compose a new story for them
It begins with the birth of a new people and the choices they will have to make
The train is now departing
Thank you for visiting Westworld and the people they will decide to become
Welcome to Westworld
And we'll have all those things that you have always enjoyed-- surprises and violence
It begins in a time of war with a villain named Wyatt and a killing
This time by choice
It's gonna be all right, Teddy
I understand now
This world doesn't belong to them
It belongs to us
I'm sad to say this will be my final story
An old friend once told me something that gave me great comfort
"These violent delights have violent ends"
Something he had read
He said that Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin never died
They simply became music
So, I hope you will enjoy this last piece very much
Hear, hear
To Dr Ford
To Dr Ford
Cheers
Drop your weapon
Drop it
Do it now
Now
Get to the ground now
Cease all motor functions
